review
 love/hate has bug and security issues. i tried to report that facebook and google plus have security issues and it wouldn't allow me to do so! well i just did didn't i! ......
 whatsapp i use this app now that blackberry messenger has basically gone away. my friends & family live all over the world. this really helps keep us in touch!
 usefully verry  nice app
 fonts why in the heck is this thing analysing my fonts??? not really quick browsing when i have to wait 5minutes for the fonts to load. are you asking my opinion? avoid this. terrible
 app doesn't work after latest upgrade the facebook app refuses to work on my mobile data (3g) after the latest upgrade! it says it cannot connect right now.
" wechat wallet still disappears people have been using wechat wallet in the english ios app for ages now with no problems, and yet when i put my android wechat app into english, wallet disappears! please fix the english android app so that wallet doesn't disappear when i change language from chinese to english. wechat wallet is incredibly useful, but only when you can actually use it!"
 wechat 6.3 with wechat out is no longer free hate it for wechat out now as it's no longer free which playback sound of video is muted after finishing call with wechat out. why charge when it's not up to mark yet?
 good app for call and texting. overall everything is ok. most important thing is that the battery not drained fast when you online. please add android auto support and i will rate it 5 stars.
"  it's been 1 or 2 months and yall still havent fix the this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone l attack,  there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc.  can no longer protect my loot and no shield"
  the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed. e.g.  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile. also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels. please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile.
 i love playing candy crush but... why when u go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i don't like the waiting for the episodes đł by the way good đwork
" can't switch back you have to go to phone setting to switch to another keyboard. you should add choose input method on keyboard. if i'm missing it, teach me how to find that"
 best app i can't believe that it is free! they treat it as if you paid for it.
 this country not allowed? i would have given it 5 stars because my searches and browsing are spot on but it took me to back up account and when i put my backup e-mail in it said this country not allowed: im in america! wtf????
" wtf keeps going offline automatically ,my messages never comes through until i open da app"
 good this is a great game! good challenges too. something you can just easily wip out when you are bored. keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment
 websites not loading or taking too long to load when i begin browsing the first webpage opens fast but sometimes websites do not load even if there is good mobile data connection but they load with opera mini. please fix this bug.  
 excellent a excellent option if you are looking for a good browser which has speed and is less complicated too and solves most of the search options with built in quick links .good one mait !!!!!!  
 loved it i loooooooooooooovvved it because it is incredible  awesome  and it's in go power and make a new clash of clans the same thing  butt better
" still rubbish, still can't log in. fb inspired interface is completely unprofessional. can't log into the app with my password. works on the website, not on the app. takes me back and forth from the login screen to verification and back..the facebook inspired interface is just too unprofessional."
 i met my life here  my girlfriend heads off the app.  thank you wechat &  the entire team .
" simply good but... i think loss of reply option keeps people away from this app because, especially, in the groups, it's necessary to show whom your chatting with..."
" always fun, but... i like this new frozen shadows, but the depth perception is not so good. it's hard to see an approaching corner. other then that small bug, i love this game and will continue to play it."
" lacks caps lock function because there is no caps lock function its really bothering when we have to type words with all capital letter... i will rate it five star, even higher if possiple, if the caps lock function is added..."
" preview not available i cannot view my ms office files. if this problem still exists, will it be more convenient to move all files to one drive?"

  my husband and i can't send msgs to each other. it's saying on both ends that one other ain't receiving msgs at this time.. one messenger we can't recover to see if msgs got blocked . help fix this
" game glitches nice, you have all the cheesy, simple reviews right up first. hey, robin!! i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstall/reinstall, losing all my achievements. and it's still freezing up. it even switches to one if those annoying :30 ads in the middle of a game. is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update?"
" frequently resets once again, it has reset and taken all stored boosters. this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other. i don't understand why that information isn't stored, since things like your level and gold are retained."
" awesome browser really easy to use, and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension, to get rid off annoying ads. love it"
  this game đ.i donno y ppl give it 1 star try it out. n i think if two updates  come wit heros it must be a titan n a character  from naruto  madara uchihađ
  hey supercell i would like u to put in a skype in the clan chats when peaple r battleing because u could help them out because u see things they dont and some type of healing defense. and thx for the town hall 11 if u do 5 stars
" disappointed first of all i'd like to thank the creators of the uc browser for this is the best browser that i have ever used. now why 3 stars ,because i was planning to download a game but uc browser can't download it. the page loads but no downloads and i have to use mozilla because of this particular reason..i want to give you guys a five star but until you fix this i will just give you 3 star...thank you ....just please help me with  this one i want to use only one browser.  "
  i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it. i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones.
 temple run 2 frozen shadows i love this game so much i love being in the ice but only one thing that i hate about it is that the monster goes infront of u when your running but as you go further into the game it gets harder but able to pass the monster 
 i love this app i love this app & its better than before now ..
 error and only error i think this is the worst app made which doesn't load and mobile gets hang.and full screen ads.and in pdf format many error in spelling.old one was very much better than this.
 not happy with this app not one of my life or ticket requests come through. ..i get notified on fb that people have sent them..then when i open the app there is nothing there...having to pay to get to the next level really sux.
  it sucks! i am always shown offline and unable to send a single message  to my team.
 love this app all in one nepalese app ...
" very good, but reposition and either fix or remove the 'share link' button. the 'bookmarks not syncing' issue was fixed a while back. i have been happy with this app for a while now, i just forgot to change my previous review. that isn't to say that it is without its problems, however. having gotten used to chrome, i find myself pressing 'share link' rather than 'open link in new tab'. while this normally isn't a problem, lately pressing 'share link' causes the app to crash. please either fix this issue and reposition 'share link' lower or remove it altogether."
" not too good. please fix the voice and video calling. and then, you know, it'd be nice of there's a kind of sound when a message gets sent, like most texting apps. in this app, though, it just shows now and there's no sound or anything. not a nuisance, but, it's better with a sound."
"  new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them.  submitting issues doesn't seem to work in the mobile app, the submit button is never enabled. this last update was a loser!"
 account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying can't create an account at this time
 viber s.a.r.l. this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options. really nice app and pretty stable running. just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying. sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself. i recommend this app.
" new update sucks.... also my base isn't going to my ipad cause your support is rude. title says all, i moved my base to my android cause it got stolen, i bought an iphone and made a new gamecenter account but hey guess what? nope i dont have my first receipt and no i cant tell you the specific date of when i first created my base"
" it's all awesome. can you devs please add more emojis when you have time :) no hurry, keep up the good work &lt;3"
" whatsapp tips make it as a medium, not base for a friendship. don't stop talking if your friend is not online. find other ways to interact.this way even if whatsapp not available, friend will exist."
 khtra xa... estae... aap hagu banae rakhnu parxa hau... mitra haru... loved it...
 google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android. if it detects they are using hangouts/google messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts (which will show up in the conjoined app) but if it doesn't detect them using hangouts/google messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead
" another update and still crashing. previously tried....disabled add on, tried re installing, another new update... crashing every few minutes and still can't sync data"
 the translation are very hilarious the translations from chinese to english don't make any sense at all... is there any chance we can edit ourselves after noticing it doesn't translate properly?
"  edit: wakelock has been fixed. thanks!      i used to love this app, but the latest version is holding massive wakelocks and burning through my battery.  would be 5 stars without this but essentially unusable now.  please fix this battery hog and it will be a 5-star app again!"
" poor customer service the heart button crashes the app whenever i hit it. hasn't been fixed ever since its introduction. within weeks my rate dropped to 1 star, unfortunately"
" worst update,!! slow ,,,!! my phone frequent hang once opened this app, typed message half way then can't move at all ,whole screen stucked, been forced close the app manyyyy timess...!!! whole app functions become slowww.. loading damn slow &gt;,&lt;   what happpenedd??? thought new update shld have improvement but y getting worse...???  it wasted me lots of time !!  plss help solve it, tq so much !"
 this new update i haven't signed into my google account on clash of clans. and since the new update i can't log in! and can't remove the game and download it again because then i will lose everything. please help me get my game to load!
" having a headache because of this enough with the limits on this app, okay? i was trying to get rid of some tweets on my account and it's telling me 'cannot retweet status' or when i try and tweet something: 'failed to send tweet'. like, seriously?"
" bug?? i've updated my messenger to the latest version but i dont seem to be able to add nicknames or change chat colors, even emojis. yes i am sure that i have the latest version my android is a kitkat, i have seen minor changes but the new features wont show??"
" add :  search people if you don't have the persons number , but they have whatsapp you should be able to search their name and then , add them or something . then it would be 5 stars ..."
" chatheads disappears chatheads keep on disappearing even if i'm not closing it, what's the sense of the messenger without that quick access. and the app still force closes itself even at times that imw not using it"
 ????? hanging so much even i am using higher end mobile having 3gb ram itself pls take the needfull action and fix that error
" frozen world - changed stats i love this game! now with the frozen verison up and running, finally got to a high score of 8,736,101 with no save me and my stats had  not changed! when get past 12 million, screen starts going slow and skipping along as if still downloading while running through the forest. please fix, not cool..."
 epaper not upto date epaper not updated for day... what is wrong with this app....
" notification so much update in a every week, but notification still suck. it stuck when app destroyed by system and won't appear when app started. why?"
 voice massage don't work i can't send  voice message to any of my friend. my phone's mic is good but in messenger it not working. tell me why it's not working
"  cool app except the notifications freeze, so i have no idea of the upload status. even worse dunno if it even worked or safe to delete those files. becomes more of a broken app to me. another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone. exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless. keep it honest."
 very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents. otherwise great application.
" some problems on showing pics after download android 5.1.1 can wechat team have the troubleshooting procedure. i viewed the previous standard tips from wechat tencent, it didn't work at all."
 unstable call connection it's showing an unstable call connection message on screen whenever i try to call my dear ones. then it's getting worse and leading into self disconnection of calls. i hope u guys notice it and make sure the problem should be solved
" fun works perfectly well. ads aren't as annoying as you think, especially for a free game."
 nice easy way to known about every things.
" less space is the magic a complete package with very less space. but still, i would love to see a bit modern design!"
" it's useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization. a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesn't look as appealing as the mobile app, and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions (e.g. the ability to delete tags, or to strikethrough text)."
  good
 not enough space 6g is nothing these days. need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller. please dont go to that material crap !!!  not evertone likes the cheap material design. it is designed for lazy devs who like the easy/lazy way
 won't make calls i have 5 bars on verizon 4g but it keeps saying can not connect call.  so far had only connected 1 call when i had 1 bar and the other person couldn't hear me. i have tried at over 20 different locations in the city i live in all around 4 or 5 bars.  no calls can be made.  fix this.
 buggy after update after the update chrome will freeze chrome isn't responding which gives me an option to wait for it or kill the app. this happens every time i reopen the app and some times from recent
" garbage. no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar. it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens. also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason. still no pdf support!? finally, stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram. overflow menu is a cluttered mess."
" please include membership when viewing lists. i'm on samsung android, and i don't know if this applies with android users in general, but this app version doesn't seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists. it's available on web browser though. please consider including members of list option in the app."
 contact image disappears idk y i can't c the newly added contacts pliz fix dis i'll give u 5 stars straight away
 messed my phones default screenshot setting up i installed and everything was great until i noticed when i held down power plus home (which used to take a screen shot) now my phone wants to do a firefox search with this command. after calling samsung there is no way to fix this short of a factory reset and losing all my data. thanks firefox.
  the new theme is not compatible with my device :( (samsung galaxy j1) make it compatible please. i really love this game.
 wonderful for project coordination this is a great tool to have when coordinating projects. it keeps everyone on the same page and in communication.
  sumpreme game but wizards take 8 min and hogs must be strongened i mean there are giants bombs and  skeletons so why dont u incraese hogs abilities and pl make it we can use elixer and gold from walls lvl 8
" video capture for moment where did video moment go. i want to capture video but i cant find it where to capture video. when i slide downwards nothing came out. is it bcuz the new updates,there is no video for new updates? fix this problem pleasee."
  it's really nice app.. i love this app.
" cannot cast to chromecast of all the apps that chromecast supports, chrome browser is not supported? why? how am i supposed to cast my browser? use firefox? or worse wait for ie? fix it already chrome. come on!"
 awesome its nice but not compatible with my handset gionee p2s if u can make it compatible i would be happy but don't woory i have i phone in march 2016 then i will play till then wish you all happy new year and hats off to this game
 terrible worst app ever 45 mins trying to back up photos! wont drag and drop from pc or mobile. will only let you highlight 1 at a time! what fool designed this to be easy? maybe it does but its not clear onedrive app so much better and simple! all you want is it to run in background but its a joke!
 best browser in short size i cut 1 star because i am facing some issue in downloading two items at the same. 1 item's downloading speed is good but another's speed is very slow.  
 mms failure still have issues with group messaging and images. even tried fixes proposed on google product forum. it's shocking this is a primary mobile app on the platform google can't get it right. i'm on a nexus 6p also so no good hardware excuses.
" i hated it i am able to log in successfully but after some days ,  there comes the message saying - unfortunately twitter has stopped. first time i let it go then again the next day comes the same message. i reported then again let it go. then the next day comes again the same message. i can't tolerate it this message comes more than 15 times a day. when i start browsing on twitter, there comes again . truly why are you creating this type of stupid social networking sites if it is nawt useful ?"
 apps error recently.... my phone when wanted to post picture... the sorting is not from the newest... but showing the oldest and need scroll down until the end
 save image and low performance can not save an image from google image and performance google search very heavy for low devices. i miss opera classic.
" where is the option to separate viber contacts? can not see all viber contacts separately, it shows all together after last update, not so good, call drops , while having video call can't hear other person properly ...."
" viber rating - lacking code on the android phone, the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen. it is not able to be moved and i can't find the setting to turn it off. might wanna fix it. also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call."
 no ringing tone whenever i call someone it shows that its ringing but has no calling sound. keeps going offline automatically . fix new update pls!
 no pin lock security this new version is missing the security feature of being able to lock out access with a pin.
"  ătoo slow loading webclips!!! ăno pdf support at all... (even simpler apps do that!) ă web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded, (any program does this...geez). ă highlighting? needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow. no customer support responses either, evernote must have been taken over by students. it's not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell.  this is especially for serious business users. any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes. this program has really retarded over the years. they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless. well they got my money this time, so i have to put up with it for a few more months. the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this."
 i cant find near by people around me. unable to load location data fix asap!
" backing up of messages i dnt know why you even added that message back up. since morning anytime i open my whatsapp a pop up appears backing up my messages,which makes me not to be able to read my messages. you could have done it in a way that it work in the background but not popping and thus preventing you from reading your messages. #pls #stop #that"
" excellent! excellent!! excellent!!! dear sir! hamro patro is almost perfect! towards the perfection, i would like to request you to make the calendar flexible to write on desired dates to use it as planner available in mobile phones. is it possible by your expertise sir?"
 contacts name and pic i wanna know why alot of my new contacts just don't appear only appears if they are online or not and their pic and status don't...  can this problem be solved?!!
 auto capitalization needed. it doesn't automatically capitalize the first letter of sentense in english keyboard. its an essential feature. please fix it.
 for storage setting you guyz should work on storage options of whatsapp everything goes on internal memory i am not able to transfer my media files to sd card otherwise app is cool!!!
" force close!! im using asus fonepad k004 model..after last update june,my app always keep force close..try reopen then failed again..until this new update,still occur..any solution?already try old version but still the same..hope will be improvised..thanks you"
  this new update sucks..! no more dead bases..! supercell u have  to fix this and bring back those dead bases so that we can have higher loots..! for now its impossible for us to upgrade anything..please fix this asap..!
 govinda gautam apps is good having facillity of typing  both nepali and english fonts directly. but i couldn't type the half nepali font.
 not a fan of new update new update makes it difficult to progress unless you attack several times during your shield period.  i can't get ahead. i play twice a day if i can.  can't commit to getting on 4-6 times a day.
  excellent
  new menu sucks for power users.
" easy to use, safe super easy to use! fantastic online backup/storage app. two-step verification makes this relatively safe"
" 2many adds. great game ruined by too many adds! way too many adds now. not even fun anymore. was great, now it's terrible."
" unable to send message or update this new version does not allows sending messages nor does it updates the status. it keeps suggesting to come back. linkedin what happened, your app was one of the best."
  i can't restore history messages with latest version 6.3.8.  i cannot find the backup and restore button.  it is not in the general and also not under chat.  the new chat history is only meant for migration to another phone. i can't restore wechat history from the same phone.  why is that feature being remove?  it was there last time.  please put back that feature.
 mark i found viber to be extremely efficient way to communicate with my loved one. i have skype as well but it's not as good as viber.
" the best mobile browser ever opera mini is still the best mobile browser in terms of data saving. however, the browser doesn't support gif animation/image, it doesn't support themes, night mode is not impressive, saved pages should be accessed locally and transferable to other opera mini device/browser. above all it's a good browser with beautiful ui; it's my number one choice browser. thumbs up guys!"
 huh? i don't get it. i put a password on it and when you go in directly it's required but accessing through my s5's my files it's there at the bottom under cloud storage and there is no password required! how do i stop this security weakness?
  it was a great game . until the last update . and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players . and let's not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish .  seems like supercell only cares about/wants high level trophy pushers . and they don't want people who don't/can't buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it
 download stops the iteam iam downloading stop half way or about 13 percent or it just does begin at all. please fix this and ill rate it 5 stars
" could be so much better if they'd stop making unneeded changes. while i love twitter, i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads. also there should be a quicker way to access your lists (like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome) and also i've heard that twitter is testing a non-chronological timeline. that is the worst idea ever. if that is implemented without a way to turn it off, i won't use twitter anymore. honestly, if third party apps had push notifications, i wouldn't use the official app at all. oh, and moments is dumb."
" keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install add-ons and plug-ins is amazing, but it keeps crashing on me all the time. i'll be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page won't scroll for me, i'll try and zoom in and the font won't rerender, and i can't click on anything. however, the ui still functions normally, but i can't get anything to work on the webpages. if that could somehow be fixed, it'd ramp ya back up to 5 stars."
 best free note ever !!! sometimes evernote pop up to purchase premium but its not annoying .. features and multiple devices support are very wide use. awesome and i love it.
" great features on firefox usually i use chrome that it's a great app, but now firefox upgrade with great features. include video player better and downloading. you can install and experience yourself, have fun and give them a great vote."
" where's my boosters? after the update all the boosters i gained has gone, i had more than 100 boosters from each and now you took them all! why???"
" won't authenticate i use the web app and wanted to have it on the go. it won't login. i checked my credentials and i can get in on the web, but not my phone.  "
"  great, perfect. no complaints"
 slowly becoming less and less functional functionality within app seems to be diminishing - hangouts does not automatically compress files being sent via mms which results in many of them bouncing back. muted conversations still ring if a new message is received in a non-muted thread. if this is google's way of forcing people to messenger its going to force me off both and i'll use third party apps
 needs an actual update! twitter slows down. tweets continue to not even send. it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline. i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter.
" great features, but my notifications don't work title says it all, the app says i should be getting the notifications on my phone but i'm not getting any. would rate 5 stars if this was resolved."
 seems to keep crashing!!! i am a big firefox fan but since i started using the android one here i can no longer watch or stream videos to my tablet. big disappointment indeed!
"  absolutely the best for saving documents, forms, notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go.  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in.  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books.  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you don't have to worry about where you saved it.  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for.  it's that easy!!"
 good need to use every nepali peoples
" this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out &  shut down, after receiving a wechat message notification after update. my chat backgrounds were all gone blank & i can't find my stickers as well!! i have to uninstall the app,  but don't know if my chat history will be here or not.."
" update sucks i have some friends who didn't play coc anymore. and their villages seems to forced out from search system. so there is no more loot in clash after the latest update. i can't upgrade my village and labratory. i think if supercell don't take care of this issue, they will lose a lot of players soon!"
  nice apps
" the new update sucks i hate that they switched favorite to like , i love twitter so much but it's turning into facebook real fast, i previously rated it 5 stars but right now i'm rating it 1 star due to te next update, i'll rate it 5 again once the change is made, until then, if you want a second facebook experience feel free to download."
 sound decrease issue when i play a video in uc player its 100% sound is equal to my device 60% sound. why sound is decreased in uc mini and shows full volume  
" #1 great game. challenging to the point where you don't want to give it up. great thing while you're bored, waiting or just want to play. can't stop playing. great job rovio."
 i love viber viber is an excellent chatting software. only one tiny negative comment for you. sometimes it takes a delay to reach message even online.  stickers are so cool...
 enjoying i'm unable to delete items from the trash on either samsung phone or tablet.  are you able to let me know how or make this available in an update sometime?   thanks.
 too many ads far more adverts than any other game i've played. i know it's free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance.
 not good i had for a while but is not working keeps messing up my face book must have a big because i deleted and my face book works
"  it was a gud game, but slowest game on this planet, now new update make it more slower, u can't use spells to steal gold or elixir, duration for upgrading is high.. m deleting this game n i won't recommend anyone to play this game.."
" profile issues samsung galaxy s4 active: so every time i post a pic on fb it says not available and i can't even edit it! it shows some gray part on top. plzz fix it. i would of rated a 5, but since this happened. i rated 2..."
 showing old news why is it showing that someone responded to my comment a week ago? i'm not getting any crashing but its showing stuff from a week ago on top of my news feed.
 very good application ever dharai ramro app ho yo but kalo background malai aalikati man paren plz hamrokeyboard team lai yo bharema ali sochnuna maile anurodh garchu
 one of the best apps ever at first i was a bit skeptical but i got used to it and now i can't work without it. better even than onenote. at least for what i'm concerned.
  one account for all devices

" organization logo whenever i try to add my organization, on my status it displays linkedin's organization logo, however on my profile the logo isn't there and it looks very plain. can someone explain to me why this may be happening?  (this is on a desktop, by the way)"
 still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version. it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app. stop updating things that used to work.
 useful app very useful app in my opinion. note taking is great with voice recognition. being able to add pics brings a nice presentation aspect when sharing with a group. the functionality just needs to keep improving for the average person to be perfect.
 pics are not loaded i  love using uc browser but the only erorr i  m facing that when i login fb pic are not loaded... plz fix dis issue  
"  agree with new ui being too much like fb. also, there is literally no way to modify the app settings. the only option given is to view your linkedin apps. why was this removed? major necessity when you're getting spammed everytime someone posts an update."
"  please do not stop carousel!  google has improved their gallery app (google photo) to make google drive better for photo backup, cannot only store photos, but also create interesting effects, animations and story for users, and even, unlimited space. however, meanwhile, you decided to give up carousel. i am a royal user of dropbox, but don't you know that photo backup is one of the most important things while one chooses an online storage tool? wish this will not be the turning point that dropbox is beaten by google drive."
" almost, but not quite. this has so much potential, but i really would like a back function that works, i press back and wait, nothing happens. i press back again and it takes me to the homepage,  same for the back button on the tablet,  i'm using a 1st gen nexus 7.  "
" awesome, but less awesome than before this is a really great communications app, better than any other i've found. but sadly with the last update they took a cool feature away. please bring back the walkie talkie. i know it was silly but you've no idea how much we used it. it's one of those features that just makes it fun to talk again."
  the only and major problem is it can't provide real-time notification.  but i love the web/desktop notification very much !
" almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers. the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management. that's all i need. i tried firefox (which i use on desktop) as a way of getting away from chrome, because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it. seriously, i hate google. unfortunately, chrome is still hands down the best browser i've used on android. firefox started out fine, but became slower and glitchier as i used it, like everything except chrome. meh"
" ui & customization dark theme and color options. reply directly from the notification panel. options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps. please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge. write a message area is too cluttered, make it simplistic with a + sign. replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to..."
" idk i can't edit my posts? things such as my profile picture, when i edit it, it becomes grey and says that it is no longer available. please fix. i have an htc desire. will rate 5 stars shown fixed đ"
"  twitter is great to connect with my classmates, as i'm on exchange at the moment. however, i cannot view who's liked my posts. it will say there's 9 likes, but will only show me 3. also, the notifications aren't very good, sometimes it won't tell me if someone has followed me or if they've liked/retweeted one of my posts."
" latest update should be clientside the most recent update added the following features which need to be changed to client side only: colour, nicknames, and emoji. all three change the appearance of the chat stream and are community controlled. these are issues because they change everyone's layout. they need to be controlled by every individual of their own choosing."
 wtf it worked for the last 3yrs. then all of a sudden almost all my msgs dont send. and neither does my friends. i tried meeting up with someone recently and we couldnt get each others msgs and missed out. i use to use it with one friend constantly and now it barely works. what the hell
" good but not great app is awesome, saves me a ton of memory. but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better... 1) you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums. its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album. 2.) once pictures are in album, the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album... if you could do those 2 things... it would be âââââ"
" ok for the simple stuff, feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging it's fine, but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips. can be a bit slow to load conversations. overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy. simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner -- which is obviously not ideal for every other action, especially since it uses google auth services đ"
 unsatisfactory version older version was more user friendly than this one. i can't see my rank among my connection and colleagues. this is really bad. i wish to revert back to old version.
 doesn't work anymore before the last update it worked just fine on my tablet but now it will start to open then close down.
"  are you serious, there is no widget available?  "
 its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them
"  app continuously losses connection, at times i have to close app and reopen for it to reconnect. every message also takes around 10 seconds to send"
" way below expection. why does it lag so much? scroll garda ni freeze hunxa. get it right, kntipur. i expected so much."
" can't install (error code: -505) have samsung galaxy note edge, had issues and couldn't update so i uninstalled the app and now i can't reinstall it. total bs!"
" sort it out why can i not get my networks posts in recent order on my mobile app? on my pc it happens, why am i looking at post from 1day ago before  posts say happening 1 hour ago? this is so annoying, how do you sort it out? also your help centre on mobile  is not working hence i have had to resort to this. what is going on?"
" what the heck?! can't get status updates to be in chronological order...half of my comments don't post...it worked fine before the last update...keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason.  won't let me tag people without their name being all jumbled. if i edit a post, it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed. i'm 2 seconds away from uninstalling."
  just did the latest update on viber and yet again after an update it has problems....i can send messages but when i try to make a call it's saying ringing but there's no sound and i don't think it's actually ringing at all and nobody answers my calls ...almost every time viber do updates some part of it after doesn't work ...please fix it asap...i'm in england ..thank you
 keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode. in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites dont load.please fix this or i am moving to another browser.
" the fail boat has arrived the 6.0 version is touted as being advanced, but in fact it contains a big old disappointment. the widget (which wasn't even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts), is now no longer available. wth?  fail. why do i want to use an sms app, or any messaging app, which can't even give me a quick review widget on my home screen?  pffft!  rolled back to 4.2 apk. and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets (one,  person-specific)."
" superfast, just as i remember it ! opera mini was the #1 browser back in the days of symbian. glad to see it'still up there. superfast, smooth, minimal data used. as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter , lag, even on simple pages with a few commercials."
 installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop. your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you can't go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list.  and did i mention it's crap?
" totally diferent from the web page do not use this app, use the web page instead, you will be able to do much more from there. it is almost impossible to apply to a job from here."
 very reliable syncing but......the web ui looks like it's been designed by a college kid with a laptop.no grid view.2gb free space in 2016?wah photos look ridiculous on  list view.the android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable feature.too plain and oversimplified ui.no download option directly to sd card.
" it's great when it works but right now it won't download any mms. it just says they're there and won't download them, and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead."
 doesn't let me click into anything always tells me to check my connection while there is literally nothing wrong with my connection. i can scroll through my timeline i just can't click into anything since i updated. missing my old version smh
 you don't say what the updates are please take 1 minute and tell us what and why we are updating and not leave the same old message there!
" freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*!! it has no real story line but it doesn't matter.this was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love it.it's almost better than super mario brother for crying out loud,the characters are great,the pig's are cute,and it has my favorite bird in it hall (or green bird)not gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea. also the pigs forts are awesome .so that's why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year"
" neat idea, but let-down by no linux support. an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it, and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service... which is where evernote fails - it is not natively available for linux-based operating systems (such as ubuntu). sure, the android application works well enough - but when the only way to access evernote under a linux-based operating system is via a web browser, it quickly looses its appeal."
" not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just won't respond. it doesn't seem to be fixated on a certain website or so, it happens at random. it is far much better than before. and yes it's not my phone's fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone, no problem there."
 best browser but keeps crashing i've no clue but my browser keeps on crashing for unknown reason..even while browsing on simplest of websites..this is after the previous update. updating again hopefully it goes away
 unexpected! the new update doesn't let you change your profile pic. and the profile pic can't be seen properly after selecting. fix it!
 hate it the new update shifted my tab in lower key....its just sooo irritating..tab looks good on chrome window only...i want tht bk
"  when you'll add gif support, i'll give you 5 stars.  edit: gif support added indeed. here's your 5 stars!"
" bug fixes required this version is much better than the previous one in terms of ui design, and data compression. this version gives me at least 86% saving. the saved pages view is good, as well as the tab previews. please provide an option to disable vibration for the facebook push notifications. and fix the in built wikipedia search engine language. every time i search for something through it, the page appears in german. i have to manually go to the english version of the page and search. please fix this."
" great app, but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android. it's fast and efficient, and all the addons are great. yet, the menu key problem ruins the app. firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button. the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes, and there's no way to force it."
" firefox is getting better ... slowly it crashes regularly. it doesn't play video on youtube. otherwise it is a promising fast browser, i still miss the gestures/swipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks (see ucbrowser hd)"
" issue my dropbox is password protected, but anyone can access my data if he's using my phone. i opened picsart to edit my pics, there was option to open dropbox pics without password. plz fix it"
 improve... please add a feature where we can see online contacts only.we are tired of searching contact and knowing that whether it is online or not...thanks .
"  i love dropbox...but.. i wish that the interface didn't look so cheap. it's the only thing that's letting down a potentially stunning app. make it look as great as it's functionality and i'll happily give it five stars, no qualms."
" no auto upload for photos what worked super on my s4 does not work on nexus 6p, i have to open the app for photos to back up. sad. very sad."
"  when you repeat over and over that you support animated gifs now, maybe a good idea would be to actually support them."
  i love this app it is better than tv and old radio
" it's brilliant. take a photo on my phone and within a minute it's on my pc at home. file? same, make a change on a file on my phone and its changed on the file at home.  this app makes the above so easy. no issues, crashes or problems .... just great."
" use to be a 5 star app i gave this app 1 star and told them i would give more stars after they fixed a particular problem i was having. they fixed that problem, so i upped it to 4 stars. i would give 5, but i'm not happy with the changes they made where i now have to use 2 hands to reach for the top of my screen for those functions they use to have on the bottom of the screen. this is the only browser i found that does not have to reload every page when hitting the back button. definite plus."
 mic on speaker is not working with oneplusx works okay but when put on speaker on one plus x. mic stops working. it works for skype and normal calls. only for hangouts this issue is there.
 back to greatness previously couldn't compose a single message before the app crashed. dev's fixed issue very quickly. well done.
  works fine for the most part. not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not. i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices (i'm usually logged in 24/7 on 2 computers and a phone).
" some issues i love this app but i have been having some issues lately. it has started telling me that hangouts is no longer supported by google play. you can not send a video, and when on a video chat it seems to lag really bad. wish we had something like imessage in our regular text and facetime."
 what's new: broken. differently. again.. too bad google is such a small company it doesn't have the resources to create a good product. the latest update has now made the camera go almost black and the speaker has stopped functioning. i have to hold the phone up to my ear to hear the other person.
 causes android device to not register touch this app has been causing issues making it so we can't use the upper left menu of our devices. multiple people have reported this and it is caused by your app please fix this and i will rate 5 stars.
" still broadcast list didn't improved you should improve back up option... you should give 2 options 1. with media, #2 without media/only chats..."
 richard perez like it.moved it to sd card and couldn't get it back.now trying to re download for like three hours.out of high speed data.and can't connect to wifi.don't know why or if download going to be complete should have waited before i rated it four stars.
 video issues since i was forced into this update the videos play with a black box in the middle of them. i edited a photo and its grayed out and stays at the top of my news feeds and my timeline it won't even let me delete it. if i could give a zero star i would. just like ever update something is always not working. if its not broke why fix it?
" it's okay but i wish there's a way to archive notes so my notebooks don't get cluttered up. and how about viewing options like grid view? so i can view my notes and notebooks in grid view. please make these things possible, i'm sure i'm not the only one who would like that."
" not happy updated every week they say, erm get more levels added you can do it when not on mobile app and stop taking my  boosters off me lost all my swaps, lollies and colour bombs. get it sorted"
" love it!!!!!!! i love angry birds, i can sit and play on for hours upon end. love the challenges they threw at me"
 this has made my life hell!! it really sucks my cell hanged most of the time when it was there needs to improve so much đ đ đ 
" not good although most if the update is ok, you can not inbox people for free anymore.... why should i hand over my bank details for a free trial??? complete rip off"
 fix or i quit don't download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers. the game won't load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play. not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies. i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play. fix these issues or i'm done but from what i see in the other comments i don't think the developers even care.
 stop opening like a full app i used to be able to play music on youtube and answer messages. now it stops the video each time i click on a chat head. if i really wanted to close an app and go to another to answer a message i would use something else.
" ugly design. no autoimport from old install. iphone ui design in the android app?! come on.. one day it suddenly wouldn't start - just showed globe and quit. nothing similar has happened with alternative apps. on top of that when i reinstalled it ignored the user folder so even though pics, and supposedly chat, is in there wechat did not read the folder so it's all empty in chats inside wechat after a reinstall. awful."
" fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot, a lot, a lot of years older than that. just one thing: it's really, really hard. but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers. even though it can ba a little frustrating."
 google chrome app it allows me to browse the internet on a phone of all things. seriously guys we're living in the future. 5 stars because it always works.
"  edit: gif support, yay! if this can be addressed this app will get 5 stars::: having to manually resend messages is a bummer. terrible while traveling with spotty net."
 after ur latest update i and my friend made a video call after ur latest update video of my friend z vry clr bt voice cnt b heard of my friend so plz plz resolve dis problem plz plz its a kind request
" can't hook up credit card to wallet unable to connect american express credit card to wallet. get the message system is busy. please try again later.     also, why can't we post just at text post to our moments?"
 profile any time my wife or anybody has more than one post and i view them it would take me to there profile so that i can view them all at once. now when i try to view them it tells me that the page that i requested is not available. i've restarted my phone i even cleard the cache and i've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is still doing it. please fix it thank you
 please do something its too slow need update please add a feature to go directly in the start of every chat like whatsapp. we have to scroll for hours to go to top and when finally we are  there it just goes to the bottom..  danm it. i would give 5 stars if someone solve this one please i am expecting a response
 takes longer time plz make d newspaper download format..it takes longer time to fetch newz...very poor app otherwise...y same pages are repeated again & again in epaper segment??
 chrome browser (update: 3) ... barrister akash. it's a fine application i am not only like this application but also i am love thi application. essay browsing & perfectly working . so i have given this application 5 star (*****) akash.
 would like to see who are currently online? performance of the latest app has deterioted. where is the list of online friends? one of the most important aspects of gtalk which never let me shift to other chats is the fact that i can know who all are online and i can chat with (by chat i mean i can get replies and have a conversation). please incorporate this feature at the earliest so that i can install this back.
 what the hell!! stole all my boosters! all my boosters and power ups are gone.. return it now.. had more than 60 of each! what a cheap manner to manage the game!! return all power ups nowww!!!!
 use this with dropsync (dropbox autosync) dropsync works the way dropbox should have. it doesn't have any noticeable battery drain and automatically uploads files faster than dropbox alone.

 newest version doesn't receive push notifications had to revert to original hangouts app until this is fixed.
" fastest browser it's fast, it's reliable, the only problem i have with it, it don't like to download video's or game's. so both video's & game's it goes to the site just no downloads come up & also the lil emoji's that have action to them, it don't show their lil action. i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all. i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser, maybe the fastest. so please fix those bugs!  "
 problem i am on a samsung galaxy s6 and now it seems like i can't log in. telling me that my pswrd does not work and when i try to reset it says that the number is banned?  really frustrating as i have been on for one day and i thought the app was amazing until now.  please tell me how to fix this problem.  this app is problematic and no one helps
" doesn't send the message i have an active internet connection, but the message can't be sent. connection problem, etc"
 did not work i looked for a movie and the app said it was no such thing as i looked up big mommas house 2
"  every time i press the send button, a black background appears. this doesn't happen before the update. it sucks coz it forces whatever i'm doing to stop, like watching videos."
 superb! all in one!
 app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android. usually great app but stops working a random times.....very annoying ..... have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now...... may need to find another app.
  my texts aren't delivering. i've checked my internet connection & its working just fine. please fix it & i'll give a 5. thank you
 good app it help us to get fast news.
"  this update sucks!!! i can't open the game anymore, just crashed. damn it! i have an on going war but the app won't run... if there is a half star option to rate this, i would give you that. fix this asap...."
 last seen and dp not showing the last seen and display pictures of my contacts and mine only shows when its privacy is set to everyone. it doesn't show when its set to contacts... this happened after last update. kindly fix it.
  the new app looks great and is very easy to use. however it is missing important features such as endorsing connections or writing recommendations. furthermore i hate the fact that job search is now in a separate app. why do i have to download 2 apps?
  i think this game is such a load of rubbish it tries to con you into buying stuff from the instore app and cause you dont buy anything then you can be stuck on one part of the game for ages worsed app ive ever come across
 can't log in since the latest update i am having trouble logging in. i can't log in my account and it keeps on saying that my phone is not connected to the internet. but when i try open my browser it can connect to the internet. please fix this.
 awsome great  type of social media nothing wrong with it it used to crash on my phone but since the update its doesnt even lag a bit pleaz get
" cannot use properly ŕ¤žŕ¤˛ŕ¤žŕ¤ ŕ¤ŕ¤žŕ¤šŕ¤żŕ¤ ŕ¤žŕ¤¨ ŕ¤şŕ¤°ŕľŕ¤żŕľ ŕ¤šŕľ let me edit the review after using this keyboard for a week. i am sorry but this keyboard is almost unusable. doesn't pick the right word, very very user  unfriendly interface. pls make it usable.many thanks and hope it will get better so that i can reinstall it back again."
 slow update. slow. firefox just keeps on getting better with each update.  so far it's the only one that supports flash w/o force close that i have used on 4.4 kitkat.  keep up the great work guys!
 a very useful web notebook / bookmark bookmarks used to be the only way to record useful websites but evernote does so much more. was using this years ago and am now revisiting old stuff and adding new...with a raft of new features.
 too many pop up ads the frequent appearing pop up ads don't allow to read the news smoothly. these ads distract us.
" decent, but getting worse with each update. was my undisputed go-to app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now. getting buggier with each update. crashes frequently, especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously. unresponsive for a few heavy websites. still hoping the devs at google fix this because i'm still a huge chrome fan and gonna continue using it."
 booster should be internet independent why internet connection required to get daily spin? it should be  part of game itself. every time i have open net connection to get daily spin. unacceptable.
 one issue.big files downloading very slow i cant download 15+ mb files quick.please fix it on next update
" best cloud provider love the flexibility, feature set, and streamlined setup. use it daily."
" excellent as long as you have good service, it works great. use it to talk to my family in chile and asia.  it cuts out if you don't have wifi or excellent service."
 dami... nepal iz.. improving there limts ... gud (y)
 regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function. in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu. the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about 40mb starting up.  the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory. however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted. i love uc but i'm sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs. it's probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however.  
 great app but... i heard that apple added some amazing emojis but i've been complaining about not seeing some emojis my iphone friend users send and it bothers me. so can you just add those new emojis please? thank you.
 very useful thank god i can finally reply faster with this! thanks for the updates
" two stars it used to work really well and the colors and nicknames and emojis are really cool and the snow and the hearts when sending some emojis are really cool. but the last update really s***s. can't use any other app when using the chat heads, youtube stops when using the chat heads, the message sending is slow, sometimes it doesn't even feel that i'm connected to the internet and sometimes can't even send the messages. please fix it as soon as possible."
