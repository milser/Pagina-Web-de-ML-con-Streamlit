review
 cant see new emoticons i have a sony xperia z3 and i cannot see the new emoticons. i have updated it twice sinxe the release and cant see them. even my friend with his crapberry can see them but i cant. i will give the app 5 starts if you can fix it.
" malayalam font overlapping malayalam fonts are overlapping in facebook at speedmode. also automatically turn on facebook notification, if i  turned off. please fix it.  "
 so fun! i'm totally addicted to this game. i play it way too much because it's so fun and has really smooth game play.
" doesn't refresh properly i added a few contacts but they don't show up on whatsapp...i hit the refresh button, but no luck."
" shake function not working. my we chat was update few weeks ago since that time i'm unable to use shake function, when i use it its just status looking for people shaking their phone but no members pop's up .please fix this ."
 cant use not being able to call any contact please try to fix. then ill give all stars
" unstable, freezes and crashes customisatins and capabilities are unmatched, but seems to freeze way too much atm. some video's won't play that do on other browsers. can't even arrange bookmarks. looking at other browsers now."
" no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phone's contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data. the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data. linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves, it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed."
 well done nicely designed .....this app had collected daily used collection of apps  . liked it.
 great but... lags waay too much. i always end up wasting gems when i die because it was lagging. please fix :)
" very useful i haven't used it as much as i could, but even for what i do, evernote is one of my favorite apps of all time. they just keep making it better and better. their widgets make the all even cooler!"
 trust worthy as always! have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops. now using it on my android phones as well. not settling for any other second rate browser!!
" its nice ... accecesible where mobile mobie data is or wi-fi if accesible so that if are are in in trouble of any sor,anyttime we can immediatetely tweet which reaches to near n dear ones & other thousands of ther too on the web........ helpful in many ways !!!"
 lost power ups switched phones and lost my power ups. i had accumulated quite a lot. how do i get them back.
" low quality i don't know why but sound is very bad, especially when i talk. i use meizu m2 mini and is not slow phone at all. is there some update or setup whitch can fix it? i will rate 5 stars if there's a fix."
" fantastic and helpful i find this app so helpful. i have the paid version, wouldn't really want the free version, as i love being able to take photos of business cards and turn them into contacts. it also has the ability to find text within pdfs, which is also extremely useful."
" simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time. each game is determined by how the candies drop, so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days. a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare."
 ugh i don't recommend this because when i tried getting into the game it says that it's downloading but it really isn't and then it doesn't work and i cant play it!. i was so excited to play the game but it just doesn't work for me!!
" you should fix this it does'nt work anymore. i don't know what to do, because everytime i open this app, it automatically closes and a pop up message says: unfortunately, facebook has stopped."
" all you need, easy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals. the software itself is great, and the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it. great job!"
 not supported i am using panasonic t10 and frozen shadows are not supported. i will be very great full if you will fix this.
 lovely a lovely game for all i love this game so much and my mom too . my mom also enjoy this game so much . thank you rovio team to make this kind of game .
" night mode this app is really good actually, but why the night mode doesn't work? what ashame đľ"
 great best cross platform cloud storage and has some awesome functionality. it's without a doubt the best cloud storage out there.
" google messenger, unite with hangouts & dialer, big problem,i have updated to android 6.0.1. ever since update, contacts in mobile contacts do not since, merge, or anything!  it acts as a regular text messenger,  please fix!  i need my google voice, hangouts & dialer fail to work or merge at all."
 was great i was going to give this 5 stars until the latest update causes it to constantly crash and force close. please fix it! i love playing this game!
 new theme its a fun game.......its great to see some new items added to the game. the frozen shadows makes the new challenges a lot more fun.
 major flaws constant updates and always getting not installed messages.  i can use it for awhile and then it's no longer installed.  none of my other apps do this!
" nice for the size ,it's great ! nice ui , small footprint. complain ? u belong in scroogle's camp !"

 love it you are able to see celebrity tweets and get info you didn't know... i love it
 ads way to many ads can't even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch. every other level there's an ad. that's just ridiculous.
 big problem new update showing all contact and there is no setting for this prob do sum thing fastly
" very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it.. runs well during roaming and with low signal.. i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group, so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion , just like in twitter etc.. but within the group not public ..would be great."
 1 of our 2 favorite games! it is a delight playing this modern classic that is constantly renewing our interest.
" personal break don't mind the break necessarily,  but i don't think its necessary.  especially during gem boost time.  would like to not be told when i can't play lol."
 i don't like the new shield system. your base is 100 percent destroyed but the attacker didn't deploy one third of his troops. so you would not get any shield. it does not make any sense to me. i personally don't think shield should be depend on no of troops used.
" it was okay, but now complete crap why do one now have to change between profiles to see sms or hangouts. before this app but much better where you could always easy select if you wanted to send an sms or hangout.. now this app is completely useless!"
" the best android browser fast, well designed, easy tab management, i was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and it's done, great !"
"  every time i play the moon struck game, it doesn't give me all the moves, takes my game and makes me lose. please fix this and i will give 5 stars!"
 wonderful apps i have downloaded this apps in my cellphone. its very good apps for those who loves nepali language. great apps.
 always entertaining we all know angry birds by now. definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time. the only thing that i don't like about it are the advertisements when i'm playing with my wifi of data turned on. they can be a bit disruptive during game play
 old is gold i used to play this game a lot when iwas nearly in 4 std but even after 4 years when i'm in 8 the this game still continues to be my fav . i really never get tired of playing this as u know now that this is my fav.
" error i can't log in, its says error occured while logging in please try again later. i tried it several times, restarted my wifi and phone. still can't log in. please fix it :("
" good app!!!i like dis app ,very useful i loved it. đđđđđdis app is awesome and very useful...!!dis app never makes me disappointed and very simple to use...đđđ"
 not able send requests to connect not able to send requests to connect even i uninstalled this app. older version was much much better.
 good app.. it's a good app for people especially student like me...but i just think that it would be better if it become more colourful..maybe not too colourful but more colour..it will be more attractive to student like me to use it..thanks for the app btw..
" good but not the better i can't see the videos sometimes, the notifications are bad and always the app isn't responding. this actually is the worst update. please check it"
" text notifications do not work i loved hangouts. however, since a few months ago, i'm not able to receive text messages notifications. it is really annoying! i receive voice calls and invites notifications. i've looked everywhere for the solution and wasn't able to solve my problem. i'm giving up. i'm so frustrated!!!"
  not since the update i don't.                                  update:- it is very slow on both data (uk ee network) and wifi (all of home via bt /work network/london underground virgin network) on all devices. version number is 13.0.2036.98649 on each device.  practically unusable at present and everything was fine before upgrading.  reading other comments i'm far from the only one having problems. high and low quality images helps but it is still worse than before the upgrade.  and just discovered that previously a double tap enlarged the text sufficiently to make it readable.  now it enlarges it a tiny amount but pinch and zoom is still required.    why did you do this?  the good old adage 'if it ain't broke don't fix it absolutely comes to mind.
 life saver!! i had to get my content from my iphone to samsung and couldn't find out how to do it. dropbox helped me to move it so i could sell my iphone right away. i still have everything thanks to dropbox!!!
" buggy. reinstall several times. issues editing uploaded photo from news feed post. only editable via image caption. then image is greyed out on news feed like it's pending photo upload & won't go away. also can't upload photo from phone gallery (share) to albums. have to open fb & upload photo, select from gallery to add to album."
" so far nice and useful but... please, introduce option for choosing who and in which group someone can add you, hate when people put you in group with bunch of strangers sharing some irelative stuff without my approval or knowledge, otherwise, app rocking!"
" linda cooper hardy it is essential at times, to communicate one person to another.  not open to all to read or know.  i like that aspect of the messenger field. sometimes on facebook i wish i could have a one to another conversation about ~ whatever.  i find it necessary to discuss more personal subjects that may start on facebook, then end up on messenger.  like a phone with no party lines, i would enjoy a privacy option.  for now, we have messenger."
 makes top left of my screen unresponsive many lg v10 users lose the ability to tap the top left of their screen when this app is installed. this issue makes uses other apps impractical and sometimes impossible as this issue holds phones hostage. if fixed i'll change my review to 5 stars.
" sony xperia z1 very good as always, but since last update i can't seem to be able to change the ringtone. reverts back to default"
" seriously needs usability updates. app is ok but storage jumps from free to $10/mo after downloading files dropbox asks to upload it, great, but it asks for the folder every time from the root directory! still, there is no intermediate plan for storage, it goes from free to $10 /mo for 1 tb. i don't need 1 tb, but i do need something more than the free plan. google drive will be my new storage since they offer an intermediate plan. i asked for something middle of the road but they aren't interested. i'm going to drop dropbox where it belongs! in the trash box..."
 hamro keyboar needs update n new emojis thnkz fo awsome apps ... :) plz update  keyboard. :)
  works great! i wish it supported expandable / collapsible hierarchies though.  
" samsung galaxy s5 sm-g900f always come back to chrome it just works on so many sites i use, better than the other browsers. but it does need this improved data savings update quick! and the malware blocking which may already be included now, i'm not sure?. more importantly it needs a ad blocker, but obviously this is going to effect google's business model. a chromium download please?"
" privacy its nice how it works with the agenda of your smartphone but, i think they might do something for contacts that didn't have the app and you want them block if they download the app...  the same way they give you the option for send invitations, they should have the option for block them..."
" nice app i suggest you to add a word-count feature and font size. i think it's essential feature for a note app. but, well, keep the good things up! you've done a really amazing job! thanks!  đâąâąâąâąâą"
 great app i really liked this app and its very useful as well. little upgrade should be made for theme and if possiblethen for swift as well. best of luck guys and keep it up.
 great app love it. does what it says. of course it's going to be slow if the connection isn't fast enough. it works well for me and my family who are overseas.
" can't connect right now when trying to open links in the facebook browser, i receive a can't connect right now error message. other items on my news feed continue to load."
" this is it: so, this is gonna be the list of things you need to improve for constant five stars - include more emojis . the ones you provided don't even express enough feelings of a dog  - provide instructions somewhere because people have uninstalled this app because they were more confused than they were thankful to you guys - when i capitalize english letterd, only one letter is capitalized and it goes back to lowercase. fix this - you guys are awesome i love this app - no more bugs keep up the great work :)"
" evernote...forever evernote helps this busy mom with shopping lists, spur of the moment ideas that i want to remember later, a file for different parts of our family life-finances, pictures of school fliers, and more! xoxo"
" issues setting up. works fine now had issues with registering verification email initially. eventually did it via the browser than the app. the app works fine now once set up, do like it."
" videos and notifications my videos haven't been working for a long time on this app. whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted, its black and white and all glitchy. i sometimes have no way of fixing it. next, i haven't been getting notifications in the app. i get them on my status bar, but when i go on the app i don't get a little number by the bell."
" 2 big issues 1 . there is no download manager in chrome , when i select save target as , i don't have any control over the download , i can't pause or cancel it after that and most of the times i am unable to download the file .        2 . i can't use two chrome tabs in multi window on note 3 , i can do that in note 5 but it just doesn't work in note 3 . plz fix"
  if chat at wechat no simbol or bluetick seen so we dont know if we've been reading text or not so i hope this apps can do diffrent thing right now
" best nepali typing apps 1.you can type any nepali text in eng and it will show suggestion of nepali words. 2.you can copy it in sd card and transfer to your pc also.and many more,you will only know after installing it ."
" worst app ever seen! one of the worst app i have ever seen. it takes more then 2 minutes to open & my htc m8 frequently gets lag while running this app. app developer, just look times of india app & try to improve your kmg app 2. for now, i suggest everyone 'don't"
" connection issues everytime i try and click on a link or profile i keep getting can not refresh. it does this whether its on wifi , lte, 4g so i'm finding myself having to continuously close app from multitasking and re load it periodically."
  pretty good if i do say so myself oh wait i did. it's a very fun game to play
" can't work after latest update i keep getting the message that the app has stopped working after last update. phone screen freezes and can't use the phone until i reported the problem (sent feedback). please fix or i will uninstall. on samsung galaxy note, first model."
" it used up my battery!!!!!! i forgot to switch back to my home screen and keep opening dropbox app, then my battery dropped from 50% to 25% in 30mins. it really is a 'drop'box."
" know how to get the account back. you have to delete clash of clans,then you download it again, then you look on the upper left corner of the screen, then you see already have a village?'' then you press it,then you will have your village."
  better than groupme đ
 update few things.... uc mini is very speed for dwnldng and other things. and plz provide an option for online videos dwnldng and youtube dwnldng. i hope iam expecting this feature from you as soon as.  
" ever so useful evernote it is so easy to 'scribble' something down when you have your smart phone, tablet, laptop, or whatever.  you can be spontaneous, yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time.  when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you.  almost magical.  such a time saver and a memory keeper."
 need more modifications. undoubtly hamro keyboard is one of the phenomenol and must have keyboard app for all nepalese who want to type directly in nepali. however this keyboard's interface or keyboard theme must be improved.  wating for new version with improved look theme or interface of keyboard. and finally in my tablet enter key is not working . please fix this.  waiting for your response.
 rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish it's very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it doesn't do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory!!! need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers!!! never will i use drop box again!!! people out there check other clouds e.g. one drive. gmail drive. just other drives!!! very dissapointed with dropbox.
" i loved it i used so many times so its more attractive me,bt every things r good if improve some more typeing system to essy type here is i got for typeing problem,so."
"  really love the new game, but since this update the game keeps shutting down on my s5. please fix the glitch"
  all nepali must use
  i found this app very fruitful.. and m using it but can you please tell me how to write ŕ¤ŕ¤§ŕ¤ž ŕ¤ŕ¤ŕľŕ¤ˇŕ¤°
" bolt i purchased bolt earlier in old phone.  now i changed my phone.  unable to purchase him again.  clicked on bolt purchase but nothing pop upchurch .  for bruce lee, when i clicked on purchase,  its ok.  please fixed. &lt;&lt;&lt; this has been fixed.  emailed me the instructions within 1 day.  basically, go to currency,  at the bottom press restore purchase. it not easy to find."
 image search on verizon ellipsis 10 tablet doesn't function properly when an image search is conducted images appear in gray scale or b/w with a checkered background.
 doesn't work won't allow you to log in.  
" its getting there. i used to be a chrome/opera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang. firefox memory consumption is far less and it's more stable. however, i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection. i use 4g and bandwidth ain't a problem. i know you can fix it but i'll give you 4 stars for now. thanks for the awesome* browser."
" so much room for improvement... the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still hasn't lived up to its full potential. here's an example: how don't we have the capability to save gifs and videos? not only that, but it'd be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances. simple updates like those would make this app so much better, not lame ones like changing favorites to likes. hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016."
 groups??? ** edit: i changed my rating from one to three stars due to linkedin's response to my review. glad groups is still in the app but i dont iike that it is not as straightforward to access them as before.
 awesome app it is good and very useful app it is very fast in dowload and easy to use anyone can handle it  
 slick chat app! reactions are my favorite part of using slack. i love adding my own!
" contacts sync won't work contacts don't sync anymore, app crashes. i've tried uninstalling, clearing data and cache, updating but the issue persist. shouldn't had released this version with so many bugs!"
 smh linkedin will not allow me to send connection request through android. but on the other hand i am able to send connection request via ipad! hello....please fix.  the new set up is fancy but horrible.
" like the new update the latest update fixed all of issues that i previously mentioned. no real problem, even while using project fi."
" good app but......... why do post come up in a random order on the home screen, i have 4 day old posts at the top and have to scroll down to find new posts which are buried between 1 day to 1 week old posts, it needs to have an option for what order you want the posts in."

" don't like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now. professional vibe is gone, poor facebook knockoff is here to stay. it's not just the aesthetics but the design as well. simple things, like viewing my connections or viewers, require more time, more taps, and more effort than before. others' connections are listed seemingly randomly, making it arduous to find anyone. it's worse on iphone, where speed is at a snail's pace. linkedin has lost its identity, and if it continues in this direction, it will lose its userbase too."
 what has happened! it doesn't give me my messages on time and people can not hear me on outcalls at all! please fix other wise i would give it 5 stars!
" not the same with my hand on my heart. i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great. the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success. unfortunately, this hame has suffered the same fate... it is no longer the brilliant game it once was... it's  an updated version, with none of the original stuff that once made it great..."
  excellent!!!! awesome app very useful thanks forum. yes in connection with the previous suggestion if you can update along with planner it would much better.

" very useful thank you android for introducing me to drop box ! extremely useful (whether on android, computer or both !) now i can sync my personal files and doucments on all my devices and i can still securely access them online from any browser. not to forget to mention about the sharing options ... great app !"
" between, android or windows10,my tablet or my phone, i love instant access! fantastic simple to use app!"
" facebook ripoff used to see my connections new connections in news feed, now all i see is silly opinion posts.  no longer a networking site at all :-("
 its suck. any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting. else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network. realy very suck.
" useful and well designed, however glitchy the app is really well designed. however, i've begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either person's end, the app does not record how long the conversation lasted. in fact, it doesn't show that a call even took place."
"  i enjoy twitter but i'm extremely annoyed that i can't swipe left or right through an accounts twitter pictures as easily as before, now just tapping the picture takes me to the whole tweet. i have to be super cautious to not accidently tap the picture while i'm swiping. it's incredibly annoying. please go back to how it was before, if i were to want see the whole tweet just touch the caption."
" video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine won't load and will play but the screen will show grey. fix please, i don't know if others have this issue, but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this."
 can't open after update the app crashes and doesn't open neither for a second! uninstalled and installed many times - no change! please let me know how to fix it! people write me there and i don't receive nothing.
" how to unlock frozen in this update have no daily challange so i can't compleat my mission, and how to unlock frozen and new outfits for players, it is very hard to find mystery box in this update so guys please fix these problems."
" causes a lot of battery drainage so i love firefox both on pc and android but i've noticed recently that firefox has been draining a lot of my battery. before this was never an issue, firefox always ran smoothly but now certain webpages with glitch out, jump back up to the top of the page on random, or just not load completely. i've checked my wi-fi and data so that isn't the issue. it seems like the app is working harder than it needs to and it always makes my phone very hot"
 jill you have lost all my photos.i push drop box.and you tell me to set up a new dropbox..all is gone..return my photos.will look again tomorrow..bad service people..
 again and again... what happened to you guys.... you are not listening us.... again there is problem in downloading large files... and the download speed is furthermore decreased... even the phone is connected with wifi... pls fix this..... 3 stars for browsing speed only
  perfect! very close to using the desktop client!
 great game i've enjoyed playing ever since i downloaded it this summer. i like it much more than the first one - the challenges and visuals are improved as well as the way you run through the game. highly recommend!
" lifesaver this app is the one i use to keep track of my christmas shopping. my 2015 christmas notebook has separate notes for each person. i can check the 2014 notes to make sure i don't duplicate.  but i use it all year around for med lists for my mom, grocery lists,  pictures i need.  it's a lifesaver for my overworked memory."
 surprised been atleast 3 years since i switched to chrome on pc. it was by chance and some luck that i stumbled upon firefox for android. i'm absolutely hooked!! proper tabbed browsing helps me keep my jungle of open app state screenshots a lot simpler. my favorite feature would be queing new links from other apps to be opened later. neato!!! made me install firefox again on all my other devices after a long time... good going mozilla! đ
" makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed.  i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts.  plus you can save screenshots, websites, pictures,  anything!  and they are searchable!"
 ???? when  i open it download but it stop when it reaches to the letter o and it wont move even if there is strong connection.please fix it i really want to play
" simple and powerfull! it's fast, small and perfectly designed for phone with low ram like my htc one. if your official facebook application always crashes and takes a lot of space on your phone, i highly recommend you this browser! the facebook feature is amazing, it's very fast and notifications pop-ups, even when the browser is close. i love it!  "
" saved pages list should be in alphabetical order as well as in newest to oldest order.... dear opera mini, i hold back one star for not giving us a choice to view the saved pages list in alphabetical order as well as in newest to oldest order. please improve on that one thing and i would love to rate five stars to this beautiful browser opera mini."
 annoying in app purchases a great product but constant popups encouraging you to upgrade ruin the experience
" this used to be my favorite app... this was the only app that i used for messaging for quite a while. that was all the way up until the notifications stopped working. this has been a major annoyance and has proved to be extremely problematic as well. i love everything about this app apart from the fact that it does not notify me when i get a message. since this is a google application you'd think that a bug so simple would be gotten rid of, but i must say, i'm quite disappointed with the google team."
 download issues using asus zenfon 5 and several times doesn't let me download anything. shows the text downloading. but doesn't. please fix the issue. otherwise pretty smooth.
 too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice. i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian. the new one is double the size and takes more space. it's not even as fast as the earlier one. what a shame. seems improved after update.
" please fix this new version. new version seems not good. i cannot open my viber account. when i tried to open it, it'll automatically stopped. please fix this one. thank you."
 very good aap i can delete my importent picks without aney kind of risk just beacouse of drop box
" buggy when i edit a post through the mobile app, that post freezes and even restarting the phone doesn't resolve / unfreeze. this doesn't happen via the desktop app on my pc, not did it happen with previous android app version."
 the new features suck for those of us who don't have a working back button can you guys make the videos able to be slid to the left to exit the video. as i have to force close facebook to exit
 can't call i can't  make out going calls to anyone on facebook..  when the person im calling answers the call it says contacting then after a few mins an operator says that the person in calling can't be reach and that i have to leave a message after the beep.
" bookmarking is no good i used to be able to pick where i bookmarked something when i made it. now it saves default to mobile bookmarks folder and i then have to go find the bookmark and edit it to move it where i want it. also when opening bookmarks list it does not open where i was last. it opens up a random list of bookmarks. it was perfectly fine how it was previously, now its just rediculus."
 its really good but.. not everyone in your address book is exactly a friend.. sometimes u dont want certain people to see ua status or dps... even if u knw them well... so if there could be an additional feature like a favourite list or something like that i would give it a 5 star fo sure...
  not working at all after updating..hangs phone nd freezes entirely... it takes too much time to open sometime... please resolve this as soon as possible
  its really lovely apps . i am allready using a another mobiles . so knows that about facilities
  is a shame that when you share picture with your contact all people that has google account sees all the pictures and those pictures supposed to be a private picture that was shared between contact.  đąđąđą
" this update sucks!!! i can't open the game anymore, just crashed. damn it! i have an on going war but the app won't run... if there is a half star option to rate this, i would give you that. fix this asap...."
 brilliant! the best application i've found so far for team collaborations.
" very bad i use xperia x8 and i think this app sucks. it never logs in, no matter how many times i change the password it always says it's not the right one. it also is not categorizes as a safe app, since its certificate is different then its name, so the anti-virus has to be off for it to connect. futhermore, it has no way to be sync-ed to the google account that allows you acces on the internet version.  "
" chat why you would make it so it changes the chat colour and name  for both people i have no idea, update it so changes only the person doing it and will be 5*"
" new message notification fault it doesn't notify you of new messages real time. you can only identify new messages if you open the app. therefore, you can not respond to messages real time."
" bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts, one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years.  the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it.  so, after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print, which you can only see after purchasing the tablet, dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices.  this is sleazy and bait and switch.  free= not subject to any compensation, encumbrance, repayment in kind, etc.  because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services."
" posting issues for the last week, there's been a ghost post at the top of all my feeds from when i uploaded a photo. closing the app fully has not fixed it, and it doesn't happen on any other platform. trying an uninstall to fix it."
" not usable no matter what i try, i cannot save images from web pages. it downloads the .html files instead of .jpeg"
" won't load everytime i try to use facebook, well lately. it says trouble loading in every aspect. it's been doing this for 2 days i've tried restarting my phone. closing the app. it doesn't work"
 viber i think so she's going to you guys you know figure out free for the rings sometimes i forget to ring in all forget to the shop. the message of this one now i'll let you know no i hope you figure out later so that's my paper right

" camera option is horrible you can't crop the image sideways... it has to be perfect square or rectangle.  camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images. and it needs notebooks within notebooks. the camera flash always on, and when you do needs it, it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture. the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document. editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch."
  loved it
 cool really great and awesome graphics. offline is great for going to a no-wifi place love it
 just one irritating issue very nice app... except one issue.     there is no option of select all for photos inside a folder. i have to select each photo individually. and there is no option to download or make offline the entire folder. one of the above options must be there.
" very poor service now a days for the last one month viber service is detoriated day by day...now the application respond too slow even in 3g network. in wifi the message is always displayed that no network available, please check your internet connection. what happend to developer team? are they sleeping? from google market viber has disappeared suddenly."

  hasn't loaded in almost 16 days. have played everyday for 2 years and now it wont let me play at all. im sure all my saved up loot and hundreds of trophies have been lost during this time.
 bad app for a great site linkedin is great but the app sucks. i always have problems opening the app. most of the times it asks me to retry or try later because the feed never loads. there are a bunch of other bugs.
 old version was better this new version needs lots of work. find web pages take much longer to load. can't tell it not to remember passwords for all sites.
  occasionally i won't receive a notification of a message(s) so i don't know that someone has replied until i actually open the app and then suddenly lots of messages come through... 5 stars if that can be fixed
 no google sync uninstall until it can sync with google calendar! i hate having to use separate apps for these things!  
" erroneous app !! the wechat app is not loading my location data and therefore i'm not able to find people nearby. the previous version used to work fine in my droid but the new version is irritating me a lot. now, this app is of no use if i can't explore new friends in my locality. :("

" it was good untill i upgrade overall opera mini is good. the page loads faster and saves time. but most of the time eventhough i have a good network connection, it will show that there is no network connection. then , when i upgrade to this version . the network speed after this update is really so fast....when i tried to download a song . eventhough i have 3g connection it downloads at a rate of 4.7 kb/sec . it took 20 mins to download a 6mb song in a 3g connection. i am really frustrated with this ...so i am going to uninstall it."

 privacy at least put some option appear offline. i mean for some people like me it's a big pressure to be seen online like you need to response on every message or else you be called seenzone only. if only i wanna do on facebook is to read on my newsfeed and just wanna response on message i want to. pls reconsidered my review. i tried to turn off chat but still can see me as online.
" game ruined because of ads. i felt like re-downloading after haven't playing it in awhile, but i was immediately frustrated. a 20 second, awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level, and after looking at the store, i realized that you have to pay to remove ads. yep, uninstalling."

" looks great, works well and supports ubuntu, but needs removable storage support. an application like this is only as good as the service behind it, and this is where dropbox excels - it works flawlessly, securely and even has a native client available for linux-based operating systems (ubuntu and steamos)! my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage (such as micro sdxc memory cards), for which a star is lost..."
 it takes me two levels back and no boosters not happy with this game.i passed the hard level an i was two level forward to the hard level and i had boosters.after work i open the game no booster and i was two steps back .back to the hard level.after that the game switches its self off

 good thank you for your previous reply. but i think you guys got me wrong. my friends are not able to endorse my skills and not the opposite. i dont know how to enable the endorsement.
 i can't see my h.u.d. on my screen anymore ever since the new update my screen doesn't show up the images it used to now all i see are words floating in thin air with no back ground to it.......not sure how to get help with this or  to unis tall and re-install.....

" great app minus the spam. best note-taking app! honestly, this app does everything you could possibly need it to. keywords make searching for notes so easy.  however... please stop pushing me so hard into paying for premium plans! i do not need nor do i want them. obviously if i'm dismissing the ad every time i use the app i must not be interested. stop spamming me. edit: why are you still spamming me? please please stop. no does not mean keep asking..."

" good job but.... please reduce its size. running services should consume less memory in background.  in new version there is no option to show only viber accounts in contacts menu, it shows all contacts only.  blocked contacts should be invisible after blocking.show only allowed contacts. thanks."
" great app!  good tool for my arsenal. it's like a virtual notebook or binder or file cabinet for me, and its wonderful.  i use different apps for quick notes and tasks (i would use it for tasks if it had repeating reminders & ability to snooze them, then also sync w/google calendar), but if i need to save long-term notes, or receipts, or travel plans, prayers & spiritual writings, how-tos, etc., evernote is the app for that.  easy to use, never loses my notes; it is dependable and reliable.  i love using the desktop version also."
  can't  play at all every time i load game it freezes then goes back to my home screen even tho iv reinstalled it many times
" nice update really nice update this update is awesome, but the quick search is really usless, but its okay. keep up the good works (^_^)  "
" possible solution to trounle entering site i like this ap.   one reviewer says he couldn't get in after installing it.  at installation i was asked if i wanted to go through google+ or facebook (i think).  i choose google.  now when i call it up, there is a link to sign up here.  if i press/click on that link, it opens my todo page.  try that.

" good as far as i have it fast and reliable. for now. only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faast, but thats mayth be due some option in phone maybee"
" fully ads based even in data connection. and loads pretty badly.. i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app. why kantipur network required ads based activities in this app? google advertisement must not be used while using data. and what a load while using this app. kmg app was better than this. i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app... while using from data, first loading the advertisement and after that loading news.. what a bullshit coding. fix this for 5 star.."
 why we have to use this? google we think its a time to make some changes in your team. who is planning and making this horrible aps? is apple or microsoft paying you for that?! what's about dark theme for the beginning for this useless app?! and make ability for sending files pls. make everything in one place. we don't need dozen usless aps!
" multitab button on top-right side is missing! ! so u cant switch between multiple tabs easily bcoz the small box on the top-right corner (that tells u how many tabs r open) isn't there any more. also, when u play video in a website, the audio and video wont be moving at the same speed, meaning the video frams will move ridiculously slow while audio plays at regular speed. i guess thats the problem with the flash player. overall poor web experience with this browser."
 i love it i love using uc browser mini because browsing speed of it is marvelous and mind blowing and the size of this app is so small. so overall i would like to say that size of it is small but the work of it is big and awesome.  
" bad new update, sight by swipe in chats gone please put back the option where users could quickly record a sight just swiping down on the chats screen. it's horrible to try to record a sight now, having to go through so many screens. by the time it's open now, the moment is gone! i've missed many moments i would have recorded before. why change something that works well and not broken?"
 unfollow tool does not function unfollow controls do not work on my tablet for friends. i have to go to a pc based messenger to adjust this feature
 want to know why did the other people i can see only 10 post and i can't like or comment their post ? is that mean their unfriend me or something wrong with that ?
" its ok useful app.xcept now, viber hasn't been working great.sometimes its says disconnected or something although i have a stable internet connection.i hope this gets fixed."
" we have a problem. so i've noticed that twitter will let me like nonspecific things until i'm blue in the face, but liking certain specific things get me booted from the app and i have to log back in. let me repeat that. like certain specific things gets me logged out and i have to log back in. what's going on, twitter support?"
" viber about the voice messages and chatting, viber is the best app in the market. about the calling services - even messenger performs better. the app isn't optimised for wi-fi usage. about the newest version (until 23.12.2015) there is a new option introduced, which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat. well, it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad - finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly."
 meh... hope it supports dual sim when used as default sms manager. and hangouts running very slow when opening a conversation
" makes everything so easy slack is easy to use and has all the right (ridiculously well polished) features. and it's backed by a genuine, caring and honest team. it almost seems like they want you to be happy even *after* you give them your money! crazy!"
" fail to launch i can sign i online via a pc but the app gets me nowhere. it downloaded fine but now that it is on my phone i am in a never ending sign in loop where i get their blurb, press the button to login, enter u/n & pw but then it takes me right back to the app's burn. frustrating to say the least after i was so looking forward to making use of this app after having downloading it on chrome.  "
 bookmark folders what happened to the bookmark folders? everything was organized like it was on my computer and now they are just on a list. kind of hard to find things when they are like that
" nice game.... its simply amazing...but i would like it better if we had custom options for graphics. it runs extremely smooth but the developer should go easy on the memory that is, it takes more space now than ever before. but overall its an epic game."
 they're everywhere i see angry birds everywhere because i can't stop playing this game. get out my head devs! 4 đ because nothing's perfect
 not bad i like to every news bt i can't get found new update please update hour by hours
" the worst!! this newer version/update might look nice, but i stopped getting all push notifications. also, the app doesn't even work most of the time. nothing loads and it keeps telling me to try again. it worked fine before until the most recent update. same as other apps, it just gets worse and worse. don't fix it if it's not broke!!!"
" great game, too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time, unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game. unless you get ad-free, be prepared to get ads up the butt."
" good ui ux and helpful in governance looking the fact that indian government specially indian railway and its officials are using twitter app rigorously for assistance and services , i am installing it. twitter is changing the way of governance in world's biggest democracy india. team twitter should also look to make twitter better and friendly for governance point of view, if any possibility persists for same."
 fantastic love it.this is the best browser on the market.i'v tried most of the others and they dont come close.keep up the good work. :-)  
 good... chrome is improving...! but there are some problems    1)we can't change the default download location.   2)app size is high.   3)can't save web pages for offline viewing.    4)can't stop loading web pages easily.
  only miss cache to be bought!  
" down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015, then one of these useless all new! redesigns was perpetrated.  now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound (silent, vibrate, etc.) are nowhere to be found.  had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet. that is unforgivably incompetent.  i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout, as many other reviewers do.   boo!  from 4 stars to 1."
 few ui updates 1. group should be included with group status... so that if common event is there then the event can be posted through group status.. and group name need not be changed. . . as it becomes difficult to identify a particular group if a particular festival is there and all group name seems to be similar.         2. profile picture and profile status should be at one place not seperate... for status we have shortcut but for profile picture we have to go into settings then profile then comes profile picture.
"  unable to change alert sound. not in options.  unable to enable alerts per channel, on all or keywords and direct.   closer to a beta than an app."

 keep calm and play temple run it's really fun... the graphic is great. and you'll never feel boring with that game
 temple run -pretty good the game is fun.but i would like it if it didn't have so many videos for one specific app most of the time. it would also be nice if you could choose to be a boy or a girl character. overall the game is okay/pretty good
" forgot my old wechat password! i want to reopen old wechat me .. but, i forgot my password for wechat old .. my old wechat info also incomplete .. there is no link with facebook .. i have no qq id .. telephone numbers also do not update .. but i remember my id .. how can i go back ?? please help me.. đ­"
 voice messages problem most times recorded message don't be delivered completely... it is always missing a big part of it. i noticed that this happens when ever the cellular network is unstable... how ever it is a big disadvantage of the app.. hope you fix it so so i can give the app 5
 why is there so much space? there is so much white space and everything is so spaced out. also the notifications are always late.
 great fun. very addictive. still brilliant! loads o' fun. very clever and hugely more-ish!! and i still love it...

 classic browsing at it's best!!! i've recently upgraded to android from a bb9900. i've been using opera on my bb for years. was actually disappointed with android at first. until i installed mini!! webpages like facebook are back to the way they should be. please don't change a thing. using mini for facebook is the best! where can i donate?
" the new updates are cool but ... whenever i try to favourite a tweet now, it closes the app saying unfortunately, twitter has stopped. maybe it's just my android idk"
 excellent reception amazing app that lets you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills.
 load shedding widget not syncing the load shedding widget does not sync. otherwise the app is awesome for me.
" awesome it's a great game that will test your patience. you may have to spend real money if you can't wait to move on or lack the skill needed to complete a stage. there are more than 1,000 stages, so far i'm up to level 82 and each level has at least 15 stages."
" ehhh. at first i gave whatsapp 5 stars. i am now decreasing them to three. there are multiple reasons for this. 1. let me send videos no matter how long they are. 2. create a feature where i can make custom vibrations for different contacts. 3. being completely invisible when i block someone. 4. wake screen when i get a message notification. 5. if i choose to mark a message as unread, it should reflect to the sender that the message is unread. 6. make video chat available. 7. update emojis!!!!!"
" no dark background? in this day and age, an app produced by a company as large as facebook, after moving away from xmpp (thus stopping the use of third party software of the users' choosing) has no option for a dark/black background... seriously, get with the times."
  i love this guy. he keep updating this simple app. i think this app will rock soon!  
" the ads ruin my fav app i mean the ads for viber desktop. i dial my friend, start talking and what happens next is: my microphone turns off, speakers turn on and the browser starts launching. so my friend is saying something for everyone to hear because she cant hear me and i am pushing buttons like crazy trying to stop browser from launching. it does take a while on my phone. what happens every time is that viber desktop ad launches about 3s after i make a call. thats the right way to stop me using the smartphone app."
" error i cannot edit my post with pictures. the moment i do, it will not change after save and it appears like when ur uploading but not yet done post in news feed and still there until i did reinstall the app. this still happens even."
" firefox for android. ok, not full firefox, but a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices. firefox sync works well. bookmarks and search history transfer as expected. really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer."

" annoying sometimes why does opera need to reload the pages i've opened for later viewing? i have a decent phone with a lot of ram the old opera could do this just fine so why can't the new one?  my other problem occurs when reading text that requires zooming in and panning... when scrolling down the address bar disappears. great. that's fine. but when i pan left right. it appears again,  jolting my text up and down making me loose my place. highly annoying. still happens when i toggle full screen ?"

  ads problem
" great game, really dislike the ads. i usually don't  write reviews, but this time i am because it's getting  ridiculous. every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying. i know the ads help with money but, at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up, and force's you to watch it."

 hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it. however adding some features will definitely make it the best app. following are few things observed: 1) the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2) few letters were not available along with words. 3) also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the _(underscore) 4) easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star.

" more than notes! just use it for notes, but it is a powerful app. like the checklist, but we use a shopping list program for that and sync with my wife's htc m8. may want to try sharing with this app soon, though."
"  great application, but the premium notifications have become too invasive, leading to unpleasant clutter. alternative options are becoming much more attractive due to this."
 continually fails to upload files great when it works but i have had enormous trouble with getting it to auto upload from my phone. usually i have to uninstall then reinstall to get this function - which is the one that i use dropbox for the most - to work. very annoying.
  i remember back when this was a âł3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups. go back to what you used to be! +rio ruined every other angry birds game.
 fix it dammit! why is my push notifications not appearing! i have 125 people enabled but i only get a tweet for every 5 minutes instead of all of them at the same time. i reinstalled the app countless times but they don't appear ar all. ive already missed 20 tweets in other 1 minute and i shouldve got notified for them all but i only got 1 for 1 tweet. fix this update im not liking it!
 better background playback and 'new tab' position firefox is the best-looking browser on android if i do say so myself. what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background (since i use youtube as ambience a lot) and the 'new tab' button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier.
" for this new update....đ  didn't showing facebook massages in candycrush... no life, no help.... am helpless now.... plz do something."
 hamro keyboard it is fantastic app for mobile and to write in nepali or hindi. i use this app becoz type in english as nepali lipi it will change automatic in neali .eg. haami nepali hau it'll change into ŕ¤šŕ¤žŕ¤žŕľ ŕ¤¨ŕľŕ¤şŕ¤žŕ¤˛ŕľ ŕ¤šŕľŕľ¤ tq
 awsome but i â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤ this game but i don't like the frozen bit my sister has had eye site and she can see the normal one and she can't  see the frozen ones so she keeps dieing luckerly we can change back to the normal one but the frozen one takes longer to load so when the frozen whone is out the window i will rate 5 stars but the rest is awesome
" connection issues app always says can't refresh now, try later which in particular has to do with the net. but my wifi works well enough. i can even play online games. i can refresh my feed at ig and twitter so why can't i refresh my fb feed? fix it please."
  love new material design
"  i don't get notifications from people anymore. also, the number of notifications i got doesn't go away after i have checked it, it kind of just... stays there."
 awesome game but... this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level there's another add but even with all the adds it's still an amazing game
 {•=•} new ui looks good but still laggy and unstable and wtf with ads???????
"  extremely useful app, but has a tendency every so often to glitch out and eat half my battery before i realize what it's doing. also needs to let users define a cap on how much device storage it can hog; i recently discovered this app eating nearly a gig of my tablet's already scarce internal storage, all on its own. i now clear its data manually every few weeks to stop this."
 awesome can't be productive without evernote.  i always find myself searching for new and old notes.  great app.
" good app for free this is a great collabo app, especially since it's free.  i asked for 2 things and slack delivered: 1. proper gif viewing 2. ability to change profile pic from app.  functionality complete!"
 server error 1-1 cannot login..server error 1-1..all my other application can open..but wechat can't..try uninstall and install again still can't..pls respond..
" very user friendly! for those looking for a straight forward note taking app that syncs across devices and has user friendly features, look no further! evernote simplified my electronic note taking with charm"
 1 star new update i am a busy man and don't always have hours to play games. coc let me pick when i had time to play. after the update that is no longer true. now i have to get on every few hours and raid for hours and hours just to level 1 building. they made the game for the 1% hardcore players. not the average player.
 not supported my phon galaxy core i have been use face book last one year. resantly i have a problam. so i will create a new account.  now that  is in a same problam. any time asking a conformation code. what s going on? plz answer me. plz help me. now what i do....?????? sent the anwer my email
  great hamro patro
"  a avid fan of wapp; thats what we call it..  a recommendation.. if u guys can include a feature in which i can stay offline even when the internet connectivity is on.. right now if the internet is on, i keep getting msgs even though i want to stay offline n receive no msgs... please work on this.. rest u people rock đ"
  its very helpful
" really? i honestly ussd to love this app.... now i realize it's honestly terrible. i still use it every so often but for sms, i suppose theres bulk in the programming but i can have 4g lte and be told i have no signal to send a text. you're better than this google!"
 sucks the new update especially the multiplayer game bonuses sucks... please return to before system... only this time im getting more loots but supercell stop it saying im playing too long without shield then u got my village under attack and loose many of my loots... ur crazy... đ
" used to be good everything was great, until i updated this most recent version. now, i'm on facebook on my cell, it kicks me off! repeatedly! i try and like something, it takes several times tapping the screen before it even lets me... if i don't get kicked off!! please fix this!!"
" how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different things, second make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use"
 man i hate google and android went into my messaging and the default had changed to hangouts instead of sms. stop forcing settings to change when you push through updates! man i'm moving to apple as soon as i am able! i hate this phone and your system!!!
" help me out i'm not able to send or receive any msgs !!.. and wen i try to back up my chat, it tels dat i'm on roaming so chats can't  be backed up on my internal sd card!!"
 way to ruin it. this game was good at one point.  i supported this game with real money.  if you can't say anything nice: i hope other people can find a good time playing this.
 hami neoali hamro dukha sukaha ko sathi thanks for the first news
 nice.. but one request... plz include 'find text' option in page.. as in pc's browsers we press 'ctrl+f' to find the text in the browser's page.. there should be an option of video quality adjustment in settings.  
 very adventurous game i love it very nice thrilling game everyone should download it and play !!!!! very addictive game i just stick on it good graphics and sound improved by the previous partđđđđđđđđ
 good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app
 smart and fun i'm late to the party. if i knew it was this fun i'd have downloaded it sooner.
"  it was, working great,  before, the bugs.  worse,  with the bugd, and without"
" ads, ads and more ads i don't mind having ads but when it's a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me. i deleted this. i don't remember that many ads last time i played this. if you can handle ads all the time it's a fun game to play but no longer for me."
"  it is best app for regular news update, but ...please add more news updates in nepali language too."
" was great, broken with marshmallow i lauded evernote for working across more devices and os than other products. but dropping stars as with android 6, if you format sdcard as internal (required to effectively use sdcard for apps and games), evernote will not run; it asks for a 'memory card'."
" ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews. there are ads after every round, whether you pass it or fail it. sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to. you spend more time on ads than game play. i develop web apps, and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living. i can appreciate that all to well. however, these developers have went far beyond that. frankly, they are disrespectful nitwits."
" amazing upgrade! love the upgrade in the game. just when i thought this game couldn't get any better, it exceeds my expectations. good job guys!"
" speed mode not work why speed mode not work anymore in some site? it always open in mobile mode even the speed mode on... -edit: after update, speed mode become more useless, even now in tumblr/blog, also somesite become cant opened, and video stream sound like lower than before, its hard to hear it withou earphone, do you want me give 1 star? please fix it if i wrong -edit-2: what i want is speed mode bcome useful again why you give advice to turn off it? i hv did clear cache or everything you said but nothing happened  "
 hooked - but no cutting out it's a fab game and i'm hooked but i do get kicked out on occasions part way through a game.
" need some improvements hey guys! i personally love this app as it is too easy to type in nepali as it automatically unicodes but you need to add some more features... this app doesn't include capslock, theme customization...it is really hard to type in big screen tablets/phones coz it's size relatively small. so please in next update include the features mentoined above... then it will worth đ đđ đ đ .. thanks"
 all in one app dis version of uc browser mini disappointed me as search showing in notification bar. and when v download anything was not visble in notification bar as previous version. its request to look into it and try to solve it otherwise as i have to uninstall it and goto some other app.

" updates poorly current update clears the cache forcing you to log in again, and of course i have not logged in in over three years and don't know the password.  try to do a password reset and the app says the email is not valid.  why would you clear auto login information in an update?"
 update suck its impossible to loot 4m in one day. do u think supercell this is a balance improvement? its not! and the developers dont even care to the comment wtf!
" great way to stay organized i jot notes for work, family, shopping lists, music , things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to. great place to store everything."
 doesn't work challenge page fails to load. it's so secure even i can't get in.
 messages are not sending or receiving right away poor excuse for an instant messaging app. needs to send messages instantly. tried reinstalling app and switching to both data / wifi connection without success
" like button the like button, you know the thing that you can actually change now with a sticker(ie snowman) after the update it has never worked on me! i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing it still don't work"
" widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a note-taker. i access it primarily through its widget. the old widget was great, giving a peek at a few recent notes. then that widget was killed off, and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes, with maybe just part of the title of a third note, and no content at all. it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason. also, there's no undo button."
 why do u do this to me ok so i can't unlock the next episode for 48 hours or i have to pay money to buy gold. so i wait and wait and 48 hours later you tell me to wait 24 more hours because i didn't pay money. so here i'm still waiting not going to pay you money. so how long with this take?
 bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now. this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet. please take a look at it and send a reply or update. (handset : note 5). hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again.
 boosters gone!!!! last update took all my boosters.  im going to be patient for them to be restored.  if not i will be uninstalling and moving on.  not happy!
 gone crazy after latest updates..it seems to force closed by itself even if i dont use it..always popup a error msg almost everyday..it seems to trigger whenever i switch between mobile data and wifi connection..
  thank you very much for sticky notification.
 want to get all 5 stars ????? reduce the amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings instead of days put it hours i.e:town hall level 6 takes 4 days put it four hours.i never saw a game that goes more than 4 days to upgrade something. each month i will remove 1 star if you do not fix it
 rocking this app is the best among all the news apps
" why change it? i use this for my facebook as it's a lot faster than any other app, but now when i try to add a pic the whole format on opera mini has changed! i can't even see the pic i want to choose now and have to go through so many folders as well, go back to the old format, why fix something that wasn't broken!!"
"  this update completely destroyed my facebook. it loads to the status screen but once i try click anything at all or scroll the app goes to my home screen. it doesn't even say force close, it just does it so i load it again and finally begin scrolling but not even 5 scrolls later the app closes.... this never happened before i updated fb!!"
" still not cool guys please, this is still not cool after all those updates. i've got a lot of ram but it keeps reloading pages that i've left open for later viewing. the old one could do that. it could keep pages for weeks. guys, seriously?! opera please."
 update uninstalls! everytime i try to update it uninstalls the app! what i want to know is if this is using my data each time i update and then have to reinstall?! driving me crazy. please fix.
 lack of options and closed code so many options for years not implemented and now whatsapp is simply copy pasting the features telegram creates. moved to telegram which is whatsapp but on steroids which even offers desktop integration so you can use it on the pc and more.
 too many updates of too big size please only send updates that are really really necessary. last one 40.22mb ! if every app ( which it seems it is ) keeps doing updates we all end up with no room on our devices. having 15mb of languages i am never going to use is a waist of memory !
"  err... how do i back up and restore chat history? i used to be able to do that in older versions. why would you remove such a crucial feature?  even after trying to backup using windows wechat, you have no idea where the backup is. it says backup on phone, but where on phone?? if it's on the phone's internal storage then that's useless to me, cause i need to wipe it clean to reinstall the system. if it's on the sdcard, then where?? comparing to the backup/restore feature of whatsapp, wechat's is an absolute joke!!"
" fix some things one letter is capitalized and it goes back again to lowercase,,emoji donot appear when i send them box appears but not emotions and include more emoji"
  i love the chrome version. only problem with this app is new tasks entered here go to inbox instead of today.  
 bug whenever i search anything it opens google i know i want to open google .. but after searching something for sometime it again opens new google.nd slows down the scrolling ... please fix this ...  
"  for the build 13.0.2036.98649  new colour scheme adds nothing to the expirience. but it's the automated smart language update, with no option to select the prefered language that'll be the main reason why i'll uninstall this app."
" the best i agree totally with the last poster. chrome is simply the best for android   period. i've tried all the other crap out there and yeah they have some more features none of which i ever used. i have chrome on my laptop and pc and all of this is synced together. simple, direct and to the point and that's what i like and don't forget very fast."
" good but ui ease of use still declining i've used evernote for years and it's power is still there in its ability to find notes but its ui is still in steady decline with a lack of ease of use. needs cleaner, cleaner separation of functionality. nowadays i'm having to dbl click a found note to view instead of a single click showing the note content. disappointing to see this once magnificent software reduced to the current level of ui confusion that  so many other programs exhibit as well."
" custom emoji doesn't work my custom emoji doesn't show up in preview, and some of them become blank! i cannot send the emoji now, please try to fix the error."
  we have wifi with full internet connection. and it always says connecting on the top. i cant send messages. fix this. as in right now. this did not happen before the update.
" developers please read. i think there needs to be some kind of confirmation implemented when the 'buy extra moves for 9 gold bars' button is clicked. i recently didn't do so well on a level and i ran out of moves, when going to press 'end game' , i  pressed the extra moves by accident and it took 9 bars even though i had no intention of continuing. i felt hurt after saving them up for so long. please consider this."
 poor data/wifi transition still doesn't work with wifi networks. even the socket/http protocol doesn't help. please learn from whatsapp!
" the authority firefox is firefox, after wandering here and there you are gonna come back to this standard browser in any platform."
 great app saves me when i'm on the field because i don't have to rush back to my office to look at certain things.
 excellent my entire team would be lost without this. works with web app exceptionally well too.
" suggestion. i given 5 stars to this game,  because i like it very much, but i have a suggestion to improve this game plz. when a color er bomb is mash with i striped candy, all of candies of the same color become striped and blast. but same action with tha rapped candy does not act like this. as works in candy crush soda saga. plz work on it. thanx. muhammad hanif karachi pakistan. no reply from admin, why ???????"
"  i used to play this game almost 5 years ago and it was my absolute favorite! i recently re-installed it and i got to say, it's very slow and this will be the third time in less than a month that i've lost my boosters.... i have paid for them and it gets taken out of my account but i still don't have them!! i really love this game, please fix the app because it's such a great game. get with the program guys, it's just so slow! besides that we love this game."
 usefull no others app like this....
" greatfull! amazing!surprise! this is the main brightly app among so more like apps.it would other more better to if we can see story,historical event are so."
" kinda like a 2d kingdom havoc fun!  if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot, it'd be close.  angry birds is crazy good though.  a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level.  this game gets more difficult along the way, but it's cool to get better as you practice."
  install and reinstall the app but cant go back to the previous version.. pls new version is so annoying. no more options for the contacts to set up if just want viber contacts only to appear. all contacts were shown even not using viber. pls fix
" whatsapp = free if you want an app that is basically the same and is free forever, get line: free calls & messaging... i personally like line more because you are able to get different stickers/images to send in the chat."
" on sgh-i727 android 4.1.2 the new platform showing all contacts reduced your rating not just like the online status that doesn't give us option to identify our contacts that are online without having to tap on contacts one by one to see there  individual online status and without necessarily having your disable/enable our personal settings. useless option that doesn't work ...frustrated users ratings going lower and lower..loosing your edge specialy with no response from you, other than the automated generic in privaye email"
  no upgrades to the game till yet...the developers have no idea how to do upgrades.... most of the people have stopped playing it because it got old and there is no fun playing it now...
 either make the moving forward process 3 bars or less time to wait you need to change the peramiters to move to the next episode....tired of waiting 3 days as you paid people up with other people who no longer play.
 ads? really? ads in the kantipur app? you guys so down to earn money?
" new user, great app. have suggestions so far, i love working with the app on all devices (desktop, web, & android phone). it integrates very well with other related apps! however, i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things: 1) allow check boxes/bullet items to be easily re-ordered [drag/drop] it's kind of a big deal for me and 2) allow duplication of notes. if these functions already exist, then hopefully someone will share how to do it, or i'll figure it out soon enough. and then i'll gladly rate 5 stars. great job guys!"
" too many recent glitches i used to play this all the time. i'm level 500+ but now can't even log into the game, it started removing received boosters n not recording passed levels so they'd have to b replayed, now it tries to load for 5-8 mins then just kicks me off, haven't been able to play for weeks now. will b uninstalling soon if not fixed. really disappointed with candy crush now."
  very useful !
" would give 5* if i could retrieve my previous game my phone crashed and i had to install it again, didn't get to keep my score, coins and boosts, the gems i paid for where also lost, negatives aside, i enjoy this game, its a good time waster, i thinks it's better than the first temple run."
" very good, esp with penultimate i really like the cross device syncing and how easy it is to use. please don't make this microsoft word, its great as it is. i esprcially like being able to work in penultimate and find it in evernote with everything else"
" loading login i re-download because my wechat is full , when bufring loading , always stuck at 2% and 3% then force close? pls fix it . i will give 5star if u fix it."
 it's getting hang once i will be chatting with someone seriously and it gets hang suddenly and i won't be able to type nor open my wechat and after few mints it saying wechat is not responding properly and have to stop it pls take a look at it .
 all these updates all these updates but still no improvement on high ram usage. it drained battery so much and my phone is very hot when using this messenger only. now there is even a sync issues too it won't sync when it supposed to.
  i get all these requests on fb but yet i go on candy crush and nothing getting very tired of it. then using the special candys they dont even do anything anymore what use to clear all rows no clears 3. no wonder no one plays this anymore
  would rate 5 but since the new update every time i try to play the new world get kicked out of game
" your new update sucks it's now impossible to loot 2m in 4 hours. wtf. are you kidding me supercell? no more dead bases and spent 500k to find a semi dead base with 180k loot. dafuq u. ./,"
" no notification displayed on system notification panel!!!! after the latest update of version-2.12.367 in asus zenfone 5, i am not able to get notifications of the new msgs received in the notification panel on the upper side..it doesnt get displayed!! plzz see to it coz i don't get notified when the msgs have been received..bothering me much :( :("
 don't use if you have a lot of organized bookmarks they recently changed bookmarks to go to the top of of your bookmarks every time you open a new tab. it used to remember what bookmark folder you were in until a recent update. i also don't like that the folders are now at the top of each bookmark list  i'll be using firefox now.
" messenger/facebook integration issue ever since the last update, initial received messages don't get pushed to the messenger app and you don't get notification in the facebook app or messenger app. you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message. you have to click the icon and it opens messenger. subsequent messages go through messenger app, unless you close the chat head... then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app."
 shite. crashes constantly! test 1st does nothing a browser should. obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release.      i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing & *bonus!* crashing the operating system.
  i have to call it one of the most addictive games ever.... but now i'm dropping my rating because it took all my bonus candy away with the last update.. fix that guys... not ok!
" not what i expected i really thought that the new updates will make the app better, but instead it became worst. i'm sorry to say that, and i wish if you put this review under consideration, and make the newest update better.  "
" does what it says it does, but chat heads have limitations. the issue i have almost everyday is that when a conversation is open in a chat head, you can not paste what is copied to your clipboard. everything is works fine enough."
"  i've used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years, but since this latest update it's become unusable on my galaxy note 10.1.  links either don't work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops & bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes can't be accessed.  i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc, but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing. please sort it out mozilla."
 thanks for this app loved this app but my one suggestion.
 nice browser but.. there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile. great options to customize the browser to suit your needs. however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites. i hope the speed improves in newer versions and i'll add a 5 star rating.
" there's a draught in th11 supercell needs to fix the draught caused by this update. this game is no longer fun. there's no loot to upgrade or donate. let th11s hit lower level bases, dead bases are dead, we're not wiping them, just going for collectors. this is the only way"
 some time creating problm network problm it seems err more reasons showing..  
" gave u too many chances i love desktop firefox, this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome, i've installed it about 5 times thinking/hoping it would get better. there are much better browsers for android than this eg. dolphin or maxthon"
 not for me i thought its better than multi language keyboard but its nowhere close to it. main problem is that it does not follow the traditional nepali keyboard pattern... this may be enough for some to  post a short comment but not enough for the ones who likes to write in correct nepali.
 thanks u so much for adding sanshkar fm kalaiya all in one ones app thanks so much dont update its great version
 uc hello uc browser i  start uc browser it s open when i type search bar web address it s loading loading it s not showing any thing but if i use vpn its working well  it happen oman lost 2 week so kindly find the solution  
 funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise
" excellent app but still needs a bit more work.. keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate.  my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing. i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately, its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards.  also like google keyboard, if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button, it would be really helpful!  then it'll get 5 stars, good stuff nonetheless!"
" bugs, bugs, and more bugs with each update. if you're unable to improve something which was already good, then don't #$&@ it up!(google talk?)  notifications bugs are all over the place. edit: application must be reloaded ultimately to be able to view messages.  edit: now crashes all day long and requires phone reboot each time."
" angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill. the player may become frustrated, but is never bored. i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time. most adverts allow a skip click."
" free the gifs not reliable on a slower network,  messages frequently don't send"
 chrome since last update you can't scroll down or up & the entire page blinks & blinks. hurts my eyes. ug. it is slower & freezes & too big.   to download mp3 of many sites i have to use another browser.  they will not download.  --mrsgwennd
 update sucks!!! it has become so slow now that no page opens even on 3g. trying to make the user interface like chrome is a ridiculous idea. as everyone is saying the facebook page doesnt open n it even logged out. please roll back your stupid update.
" it's ok !!! only 1 request... its been now more than 1-2 yrs for whts app but desperately waiting for feature which shows active or live whts app users from contacts. if whatsapp add this feature, then 101% sure whatsapp will rock... !!!!! đđđ"
  everyone loves slack. count me among them
"  i do not want to search for new connections every time i open the app. no means no, just live with it and keep the experience smooth."
" no longer a casual game the current version of the game makes it too hard to play casually anymore. expect to spend 4-6 hours a day, just to stay afloat."

" great and solid app. love the widget. most important feature about this app in my opinion. couple things: number and bullet point lists don't show as formatted when seen on the widget. please fix. also, i'd personally like it if emojis were implemented. i'd also like it if we had more control over the appearance of the widget (opacity, font size/color, background color)."

" the best game about they dont call this the no.1 app for nothing, its the original and best clean game about. one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling (funny though, i thought they had wings). it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come! (it's as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s) it's so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it. for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future. the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet, but thankfully, the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline."
 its just ok in news paper there alot of time to loaded even in wifi 512kbps
" shit guys dont download it. the new update sucks. there is noo looot base after update. especially new ones who download it will affect seriously. the true color of supercell is revealed. they want to buy gems, because we don't get loot"
" browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc, still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc, app does not use user input options (ignores them) again, still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozz's www. page.  shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore.  also they keep editing my review ??????."

 just a tool for them to throw ads at you they use this app to electronically monitor your messages looking for key words. once it recognizes a grouping of words it will start to send adds to your news feed that are similar in subject to that of which your talking about in your conversations
" utter garbage didn't think i would be saying this as i'm a firefox user myself, but the browser is utter garbage. i've got a samsung galaxy tab s2 and the browser crashes constantly. i'm switching to a different browser :("

 absurdly large file for an android browser and after lollipop upgrade i no longer have the space available for updates. would gladly uninstall if i could. over 40 megs for an android browser??
 outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular. this is the first app which can be useful for all people.  
" downloading files in background i started a song download but it failed,  then after 2 minutes it automatically downloaded 2 copies of the song in background....  "
" miui7 y is the photo n sights won't show up in moment although i refresh so many time ad, fix the probs pls"
 please add this option i love using hangouts for both im and sms but when sending a photo from the share menu the app defaults to my sms plan thus costing me money. if i try to go back the hangouts app quits. leaving me with no way to choose of i want to send a picture via mms/sms or hangouts (im). its costing me a small fortune. the option to choose how which messaging service you want to use when sharing a photo would be great.
 why can't google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have. i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works
 somethings missing is there a possibility to have your troops have the 'winter' theme? like having the wizards red cloaks or max lvl balloons with red colored balloon and pekka that is literally a sword-wielding snowman? its worth it  to add those features rather than just making it snow while covering some buildings with snow.
  nice app
" didn't work couldn't use it with my note 4, it just gets stuck in the red o and stops"
 love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space. you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life.
 call disconects in every 5 seconds thats two beep sound is now one of my most hated sound from viber. can't u guys fix it before i uninstall the app and use other app
" need swipe between images nice app, but it would be really nice if you could swipe between images when viewing them full size."

" works but very basic, needs more. works fine, needs interface update. how about thumbnail/icon views, or a small list, for instance? photos need a timeline, or even a -gasp- metadata/exif tag search? how about embedding carousel functionality, and adding to it? google photos is far from perfect, but does have good ideas."
 not good its previous version (12.0.0.15.14) is much good than that. i can't text directly with current version. please add the inbuilt messenger again in the app.
" definitely worth your time. there are too many lousy whiners reviewing this amazing app. if you're not happy, take a long hike douchebags!!"
 amazing game awesome game so entertaining and very fun. this app is my favorite game. i hope evrybody put's a 5 star for rating because this app is cool.
 very smooth i'd say it's much better than just uc browser which loads pages as if you are on your laptop with a really bad server. love everything about it !  
 it's good i had typed up a longer review but then play store decided to crash... i'll just say that firefox for android feels faster and more stable than the default chrome browser. also the ui is less clunky.
  too much pop up add
 support service poor support service.
 not able to see recently connected people hi i am not able to see the recently connected people in the notification tab.from where i can see the people with whom i connected recently.
" simply brilliant simply brilliant, no problems so far.  the best feature of this is the accordion of tasks that are grouped.  could not login with google but simply clicked forgot password and set a new password and it worked perfectly as described in both the description and app.  cheers.  "
 favorite menu update is suboptimal the new update puts the entire list of favorites into view from most recent instead of returning me to my previous folder which it always has. this requires more time and clicking to get to the desired folder. please give an option to return it to the previous version.
  doesn't seem to work at all. no widget and doesn't sync with site.  
" emoji đ hey bro, please add more emotions. can emotions be little bit larger in resolution?  your app's assets consist more emoji but are not loading in app. there should be a way to flip to next emoji page."
 annoyed whatsapp used to work great!! but with the recent update messages didn't want to come through unless i went into the app. i assumed it was my phone but samsung said everything is working great. so i was advised to uninstall and then reinstall whatsapp. i did just that. it picked up my old number and backed everything up. until it got to the initiating please wait a moment page it's been 3h now and nothing has changed. is there any way to solve this? i would really like to get back online.
 5-stars.! this app has saved my life on multiple occasions...pictures are life and you help keep mine with me

 1 major annoyance in the new update show who is online and define what online means.  on hangouts? on a google product?  using g+? can you re-add timestamps for each message? please add a dark mode feature as well
" constantly erases text i have frequently lost messages i've been typing, sometimes very long ones, when the screen changes orientation. if i tip my screen even a little and messenger shift the orientation it instantly erases everything i've written."
 changeable it really change our way of getting news
 it was epic....then a certain update happened the most recent update got rid of what a ton of people loved. i think supercell has some work to do if they think i am gonna be buying any more gems.
" forced reload on uploading pic on replying comment last night i tried to reply a comment by uploading a photo from my phone. when i press on the button to select photos the app automatically goes back to the main page. on other occasions, i could enter to my gallery to select my image but as soon as i selected an image and press done, the program, again, forced reload and suddenly go back to the main page. please fix this and i will change my rating. thank you."
" neat nice ,smooth ,speed but downloading is lacking in speed correct this i'll give u 5 star  "
" inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible. 1) it crashes constantly, 2) scrolling is very jerky, 3) on screen rotation the window doesn't resize, 4) there is no word wrap when answering certain forums, 5) downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone, 6) pages are very slow to load. both the pre-installed samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox. pity."
" really cool and organized. the new update is really amazing, the widgets are cool, however, it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support (like hebrew, 'cause when i want to add check box the text removed to the left). also, you need to add an option to change the size of the preview (don't like it's so small), and app animations would be nice. something else to your attention: i want to by the app, but it really (really) expensive. if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it."
" some notification problem although i've enabled notification,  i am not being able to get notification only from ekantipur on my htc desire 826 and it is slower than in other inferior devices. i want to know if this problem is only with me or ekantipur is working on this kind of device..notification feature is very useful for a busy person like me who doesnt get much time to sit back and read news. notifications enables to take a quick look at headlines and understand the situation and can read the selected news according to choice."

" issues with address book contacts i have turned off the feature to update my android contacts based on linkedin information. but it still keeps updating with unwanted title on my address book. i have uninstalled the app n reinstalled it, cleared the data for the app but made no difference. i am using galaxy s6 and would really appreciate if anyone can solve this issue. the best option seems to uninstall the app for good and use just the broswer."
 works great maybe you could do something about the download location. i can't change it to external storage. i don't want the downloads to fill up the phone memory. please do something about that.
"  does exactly what it states, thank you!  "
 keeps losing connection ever since the update messenger has been losing connection and i don't get how if i'm connected to wifi and it's just been doing that ever since. and also i thought the chat bubble allows you to open the chat while on another application? well now ever since the recent update every time i open the chat bubble it exits me out the application i'm on. i don't know if it's a bug or something but please fix it.
  great internal comms system for our business
" came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power, unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu."
"  i have had to uninstall this app twice this week because whenever i try to edit a post, the post doesn't edit and just stays gray and stuck in the loading process forever. my o.c.d. can't handle that :-("
" force close it's been 1 or 2 months and y'all still haven't fix the error. i can't play, it's always crash and force to close everytime i'm online for 10 seconds."
  it sucks right now the special  levels are rigged  i'm sure you can't win just waste your lives and boster f it ready to un install it
 doesn't work 90% of the time. doesn't update my news feed says cannot connect to internet. the internet on my phone works just fine. i can uninstall and reinstall and it fixes the issue for a few hours then it starts saying cannot connect to internet.

 new update killed the game new matching for atks basically killed the farming part of the game so you no longer can aquire resources for upgrades. get your money ready because buying your resources will be the only way.
 works really well slack for android works flawlessly on my nexus 7 and is way better to use than the ios and desktop versions. the latest update has fixed a couple of the ui/ux issues introduced in the previous update and glad to see the scrollbar's back when you swipe up to view the channel history.
  it's notification system is so poor. it doesn't notify me when any message arrives. no it's too slow to chat also.
" connection issues with the version it says can't connect to server. , with error report 1 -1. everytime either connected with cellular data connection or over wifi"
"  always sorry, messenger has stopped. besides, my friend offline for a few minutes already then it just show active a few minutes ago. sometimes it is very lag. pls fix it."

 too much going on its cool it works but ony using it because i have to its got way to much going on for a note pad.. adds in useless irrelevant information like i made a note on a friends birthday now it says from so and sos birthday but it works great just wish it was just a plain jane note pad like the one htc used this app to replace. if there was a way to over complicate a note pad app they did it.it works great like i said and it takes some getting used to and it grows on you..
 tablet support any chance of getting tablet support anytime soon?
  i had over 500 lives and the game wouldn't work so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and i lost all my men. give them back and i will change my rating. my gold was still there but not my lives. not a happy camper.
 following back it doesn't let me follow people that have followed me back.. and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect.... overall it is a live appp
" doesn't work whatsapp messages weren't sending at all (it wasn't a connection problem, i checked) so i tried reinstalling and it won't even let me set up my account now... they ask for my phone number and it keeps trying to connect and fails (again, not a connection problem) what do i do? :/"
 bullshit update... after updating its totally headache...nt able to download ...instead of mobiles its more suitable as pc...when we search anything its always searhing for websites..previously it was asking sepearately for web n image search...apart from this dwnldng is tatal worst as compare to previous version...  
" umm.... while this game has gotten kinda old, and i've basically replaced it with the soda saga game, i still like playing this but for some reason, for i don't know how many days now, every time i go to open this game it'll load a little and then crash closed. fix please!!!!!!!!"
 pretty good the people who don't like the power ups can just turn them off in the first part of the game!!!!! i also like the red's mighty feathers.
 its not safe it has a link to gallery and file manager also.  so anone can easily get access to my private photos without any password or restriction
 can you say ads every time i open a tweet there's an ad sitting at the bottom. they appear ridiculously frequently throughout my feed. i get that developers are trying to make a living but come on this is so excessive
" fix this please... i've tried editing two of my profile pictures in the past month and each time i do.. it doesn't post it, but it also doesn't go away. it fades out the picture and it's always at the top of my time line. now i have one from december 14th, and the second one from tonight at the top of my time line and it won't let me delete them, or do anything about it. and it's really buggin' me. please fix this."
  addictive!  the only negative is that you're never given gold bars.  you have to buy them.
 ⭐⭐⭐ when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top! the only social app that does that! such a headache!
" excellent this app is great, keep up the good work guys !"
  i can't send messages because in my settings i don't have sms all i have is account settings fix it i thought when i got it it would be good but i thought wrong
 good game but... i have always liked temple run however the new update which included a new map has ruined it for me a little bit.  i would of rather of it been snowy on the default map since since for me anyway the new map is a bit confusing and can be harder.

" the app made me i'm rating it because of a pop up on the app,but i like twitter so i'm going to give it 5 stars. the only thing i don't like is the fact that i can't edit posts,f-ing instagram can but twitter doesn't have option wtf"
 not so good remove all contacts please... a lot of ppl hate that soooo much... it's boring and ugly... till i find wanted contact need to search for it 2 minutes...
" boo! it loads slow even on my hardware. considering kmg is the leading news company,  the interface is very poor! i your app is almost like direct links to your websites. and the difference between the low resolution and high resolution files in e-paper is not perceivable at all."
" nice app, bad notifications i like the browser, but having updated can't recommend anymore. push notified about a competition! no one wants that kind of alert."
" i want the old theme back!!!!! this theme is awful. previously opera mini was the best browser but now i think it's worst. no, i don't want to see the news or anything. just return the old opera mini back. you just make it awesome to awful."
  i can't see and upload my photo at the moment... why? before this..wechat no problem but now.. why?
" still the best mini i like the new look and news front, very fast and efficient, though for overall best all around browsers id go with maxthon, yandex and uc...but for mini's opera mini gold though uc mini is coming along strong..***minuses: needs an adblock."
  unbelievably bad support by google for their own products.  had to hard reset my android 4.04 tablet and could not reinstall chrome because google no longer supports chrome browser on android 4.0x.  so i had to install a non google browser. i would give a rating of 0 if i could.
" what happened to you opera... the resent updation make the browser more beautiful to look  than the previous versions; but the smoothness of the browser is gone.. yes it have some unique properties whwn compared to other browser such as data saving mode,re open closed tab etc.. but the problem which i face is that.  1- the web pages are not fit to my screen- ie the all the web pages opend through this browser is shows only3/4 part of my screen.   2- annoying ads on the home screen of the browser.   3- private browsing is not working."
  why what's app does not support same account on multiple devices that's security but that's not good i buy a new phn sometimes i used to go with any phn then i have to switch to that that's not good should support same account on multiple devices
 privacy you must provide system in which no one should be able to download profile image. moreover if there will be video calling option then 5 rating is must! kindly do the needfull..!
 all time legendary game the birthday party levels and short fuse levels are fantastic.especially when the pigs crash onto different chemicals is just great.suggestion to all those players who cringe about too much ads is close ur wi-fi connection and then play the game.then the ads won't trouble you.
" ads for some whatever reason sometimes, which is more then you think, would open and show me some security ad. i'm not even clicking on chrome and this still happens. plz fix this annoying thing"
" help me!!!!!!! my ipad had a software so i lost my base, i need it back, please, i left my base in a clan that shows my code on the top left on my profile, now i have 2 accounts please if any can help me i would really love this game, but at the moment nobody is helping me. thank you very much i hope you reply and i get my account back"

 uninstalled i downloaded this app thinking it would soon be supported with google for log in and sync with chrome web version cant or wont do two separate  apps for a to do list!  :(  will give 5 star when this is a reality!)  
" light, fast, and comfortable apps when i compare 3 different browser, watch speed connection, ram and cpu usage then i know opera and their products is very good for smartphone and pcs"

 not good this app before was no. 1  nepali app in android but when they update the app it is now really wasteful.after using the app there is no exit  button. please fix it. still  not yet  done the improvements. what's wrong with the app ???problem in my  samsung galaxy s3  only ??
 it is fine.. and getting better.. working quite well for me at the minute. i liked the recent layout changes and messaging facilities. websites links are handled better and able to open in browser as well. the problem with notifications still exists.  i can't tell if someone accepted my connection request or send me an invitation. notifications appear for a second and go away.
 dud on droid4 doesn't work on my new droid4

" messenger issues ever since the last update, initial received messages don't get pushed to the messenger app and you don't get notification in the facebook app or messenger app. you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message. you have to click the icon and it opens messenger. subsequent messages go through messenger app, unless you close the chat head... then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app."
 very good i liked the app and it's ui but i think the app can be best if you add option to remind us about any program on radio so that i wouldn't miss my fav programs like timepass :) ....keep developing
 can't get off first base. having give problems synchronizing with the web version.  keeps asking for login password and never goes further.  reinstalling for last time before i give up  
" bugs with contact syncing very frustrated. after having this app work fine for a couple years, i get an update that screwed up my contacts. i've read others' comments and the supposed solutions, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app. for a brief few hours last night, it appeared to re-sync my linkedin contacts back to my phone contacts. today, gone again. in any case, even when the contacts came back, all my previously set up shortcuts to those contacts were disabled. can you fix this linkedin? i use a samsung galaxy 3s."

" not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of, no benefits either. issues begin to arise, and multiply exponentially, upon applying any changes. if using a text size other than the default a substantial lag/reloading begins to occur when scrolling. zooming in, or out, causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank. also, in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras."
 can't change my color like every one els my friend updated his when i did mine we have the same phone he got to change colors an mine stayed the same ether fix or i'm not using this crap app any more

" ââââbestââââ hamro nepali keyboard is doubtlessly, the best keyboard for fluent nepali typing on android mobiles and tablets. it has given  oppurtunity to thousands of nepalese people for sharing their thoughts, expressing their feelings and chatting up with buddies through  common and national language i.e, nepali. thumbs up for creating this amazing app!!! wish you'd also add some theme customization options and improved caps lock option."
" candy crush. i have been  having trouble playing on candy crush so in the end i uninstalled it , i then re-installed and signed back in, in doing this i'm back to my level but lost all my boosters."

 classic game ruined by ads. uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads. installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet. wondered why he kept crying and complaining. realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level. ridiculous.
" updated version is down not able to sent connection request, no contacts synchronization . please develop soon"
"  often painfully slow. needs a useful tablet ui, quick reply, and the ability to send video. some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that isn't really excusable from the company that runs android. this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets."
" great code but arrogant company linkedin should be proper stewards of the database they have created. and ensure their customers get optimum use. too many gotchas; no cut and paste from messages, closed api's, etc. pretty narrow minded."

" i wish there is a mute button for selected people. i like it so far but it is more like a skype now. but i hope next update the will be option like mute button where i can mute someone so that i won't recieve any notification from that particular person without deleting the message or blocking them coz that would be so rude if i do that. or option where i can hide the seen or a mark as unread. other than that it is good i liked it, that's all my concern."
" once a great game i was a hardcore fan of this game. but u gotta admit... the latest update sucks... its impossible for farming... if u wanna make some loot, u gonna have to go gowipe or something. it takes a minimum of 1 hour(without boost) to make troops. and that sucks... plz fix this asap before i with many others move on..!"

" really great! twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day. i do have problems with it though. [this is personal preference] whenever i refresh the page, it gives me a tweet with the subtext [twitter name] follows [twitter name] and it happens every time i refresh, so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets? othe than that its fine."
" why can't i share my achievements? recently discovered that there is a feature for sharing any kind of achievement, however i can't accomplish it on my profile"
 beta is the best version of the chrome browsers can't open bookmarks in a new tab or incognito window. can't switch tabs from bookmarks tab. horrible features. the following are issues across all barstools of the chrome browsers: no desktop preferred option. webpages refresh themselves by default and you lose what you are typing of you switch to another app. tabs mixed into os is annoying. no user agent switcher
" great little game. this is a great little game.  i am completely addicted to this game.  it's simple enough to learn, but has enough variety to keep you  interested.  this is an ad supported game, just so you know.  i would be happy to buy the game together rid of the ads, however i haven't found where to do that yet."
" keeps crashing ever since i started using it more, it will crash every ten minutes. its starting to get more annoying, however it is convenient for saving text messages since i don't have unlimited messaging"
"  even though i am loving the new update, but this breaks the default contacts app on the note 5. under accounts linkedin sync has no account header name and that breaks editing of contacts.  update: opened a ticket with linkedin support and they agreed that the contacts app break on merged contacts is a bug. this is with their engineering team to be fixed. update2 : contacts force close exists as off version 4.0.11. update3 : finally the contacts bug has been fixed."
